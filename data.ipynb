         "Impaired neuronal and synaptic function are hallmarks of early Alzheimer's disease (AD), preceding other neuropathological traits and cognitive decline. We previously showed that SFRP1, a glial-derived protein elevated in AD brains from preclinical stages, contributes to disease progression, implicating glial factors in early pathogenesis. Here, we generate and analyze transgenic mice overexpressing astrocytic SFRP1. SFRP1 accumulation causes early dendritic and synaptic defects in adult mice, followed by impaired synaptic long-term potentiation and cognitive decline, evident only when the animals age, thereby mimicking AD's structural-functional temporal distinction. This phenotype correlates with proteomic changes, including increased structural synaptic proteins like neurexin, which localizes in close proximity with SFRP1 in cultured hippocampal neurons. We conclude that excessive SFRP1 hinders synaptic protein turnover, reducing synaptic plasticity—a mechanism that may underlie the synaptopathy observed in the brains of prodromal AD patients.",

         "Acting intentionally requires the integration of perceptual with action information in a common representational format. In the action control literature, this integrated representation is often called event file and is measured in so-called stimulus-response binding effects. These effects allow us to measure the strength of this shared representation and the impact it can have on behavior. A well-established finding is that particular variables can modulate the size of binding effects – one recently discovered modulator is stimulus predictability: If perceptual information is perfectly predictable, stimulus-response binding effects diminish. Yet, the concrete mechanism of why predictability diminishes stimulus-response binding effects remained elusive so far. In the present study (N = 234), we compared two possible explanations for these modulation effects, namely habituation versus statistical learning. We found that it is unlikely that the predictability modulation is explained by habituation. Instead, we found evidence that is more in line with (but not exclusive to) learning of statistical regularities as an explanation. Our study thus adds to recent attempts to more closely relate learning mechanisms and action control.",

When it comes to understanding what affects DX in software platforms, researchers and practitioners recognize several factors. This topic still lacks a roadmap regarding the main DX factors, primarily when considering platforms in software ecosystems. Thus, this study aims to investigate and characterize the factors that affect DX in software platforms. After investigating the literature, we selected 35 studies to analyze the state-of-the-art of DX in development on software platforms. As the main contribution, we provided a set of factors organized into six categories that affect DX in software platforms. This set of DX factors can be used as a reference guide to support researchers and practitioners in improving the development processes of the products and services on software platforms.",

         "The landscape-scale impacts of habitat subdivision (fragmentation per se) on biodiversity are not fully resolved. While smaller patches usually contain more species for equal total area, many implications of this remain unclear. For example, do equal areas of smaller and larger patches provide equivalent habitat value? How might this change over time and under differing matrix conditions? To help address these knowledge gaps, we developed an indicator of relative habitat value based on a species-individual null model. We used the indicator to compare sets of patches ordered in small-to-large and large-to-small orders, building hierarchical Bayesian regression models to test the role of time since patch creation and contrasting matrix conditions. This allowed us to assess habitat value for 85 metacommunities inhabiting fragmented landscapes (1354 patches, >4500 species). We expected comparable habitat value following patch creation due to unpaid extinction debts, and the matrix would determine the direction of change over time, a harsher matrix increasing the relative value of larger patches. Averaged over time and matrix quality, the indicator probability density was mostly negative, suggesting slightly greater habitat value among larger patches. This pattern was consistent across taxonomic groups, although amphibians and reptiles were the most affected, and invertebrates least so. Larger patches were of greater value within 20 years of patch creation, but over time smaller patches increased in value under any matrix type, whereas value remained constant for larger patches. Matrix conditions mediated the relative difference: after 100 years under a light matrix, patches of all sizes were essentially of equivalent value, while larger patches were still favoured under a harsh matrix. Policy implications. In long-fragmented, light matrix landscapes, small and large patches apparently offer comparable per-unit-area habitat value. Conversely, under a harsh matrix, larger patches retain slightly greater habitat value. We speculate that this reflects a ‘colonization credit’, which might occur within smaller patches after the initial loss of fragmentation-sensitive species in disturbed landscapes. Overall, analyses support the need to maintain and enhance total habitat area—regardless of configuration—for biodiversity conservation, especially in long-fragmented landscapes with light matrices.",

         "Purpose: This exploratory research aims to unravel how Chinese international students form their decisions regarding the school-to-work transition (sometimes also referred to as the university-to-work transition) when studying abroad. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the concepts of school-to-work transition and cultural approaches to investigate how Chinese graduate students make career decisions to navigate the school-to-work transition in the context of international mobility. The authors' empirical study is based on 30 semi-structured interviews conducted with Chinese graduate students studying in the Netherlands. Findings: The authors discovered four patterns with two major subgroups among Chinese students studying in the universities in the Netherlands based on their initial intentions: return-return, open-return, open-stay and stay-stay. These patterns made sense when navigating the school-to-work transition: participants experienced varied international experiences, cultural perceptions and acknowledgment influences when enhancing employability and shaping their career decisions. Participants in the return-return and stay-stay groups indicated strong resilience and consistency in achieving their goals and strongly focused on long-term objectives. However, participants' open-return decision demonstrated a thoughtful alignment of personal goals and knowledge of the possible beneficial influence they may have in their home country. Open-stay participants utilized the overseas study opportunity to finalize their decisions and increase their employability in the local labor market, thereby creating a transition from university to work in the host country. Originality/value: The authors highlight the way Chinese graduate students manage their international experience and provide novel insights into the role played by the cultural characteristics of their home country and host country.",

         "This book examines the Indo-Surinamese Girmitiya peasants and their contributions to developing the ethnic community within their newly adopted home. It demonstrates the transformation of the Girmitiyas from agriculturalists in British India to plantation labourers to peasants and finally to urban dwellers. The author argues that it was the Girmitiya peasants who had made greater contributions to developing the ethnic community over the labourers of whom about one-third returned to British India. The work covers the history of how the peasants institutionalised their practice, changed the physical landscape and integrated economically and politically as an ethnic group in their newly adopted homeland. Furthermore, the author presents arguments to demonstrate that Girmitiya peasants survived the plantation labour and peasant life due to their knowledge and skills of agrarian cultivation, known as agrarian human capital. The scholarly literature about the labour migration from British India has focused heavily on the fate of the labourers. Consequently, the history of the Girmitiya peasants as well as the cultural heritage they have produced has been grossly neglected. This book purports to fill this void by telling the history of Girmitiya peasants in Suriname, a Caribbean society adjacent to former British Guyana.",

Findings The results from 10 included studies (5068 participants) did not find preventive interventions to be superior compared with active or passive control conditions regarding symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (g=0.08 and g=0.05) and depression (g=0.13 and g=0.32, respectively). Effects on anxiety symptoms remain unclear. Aggregated effects for all outcomes were significant at follow-up compared with passive controls, but the interpretability is limited by the low number of studies. Intervention effects were not significantly associated with intervention type (psychotherapy vs psychosocial), age or delivery mode (online vs face-to-face). The risk of bias across studies was high. Conclusions The current evidence does not allow for any recommendations regarding prevention programmes in the aftermath of natural hazards. A larger body of high-quality research is needed to develop effective and evidence-based preventive interventions for disaster survivors and responders. Study registration https://osf.io/4es65.",

         "Extant research on corruption has uncovered the important role of norms. Yet, little is known about how people view specific acts of corruption in countries that differ in the prevalence of corruption. The present research examines moral judgements of four different types of corrupt acts in a high- versus low-corruption country, thereby providing a critical test of two opposing hypotheses. The descriptive norms approach predicts that citizens of a high-corruption country will be morally more lenient than citizens of a low-corruption country. The relative deprivation approach predicts the opposite, that citizens of a high-corruption country will morally condemn corrupt acts stronger than citizens of a low-corruption country. Drawing samples from the Netherlands and Indonesia (a low- vs. high-corruption country), two experiments (total N = 477) show that Dutch participants are often more morally permissive towards corruption than Indonesians, although specific results varied for the four types of corruption. This largely supported the relative deprivation approach. In addition, Indonesian participants expressed more disappointment and anger towards corruption than Dutch participants. This research suggests that feeling deprived through regular corruption experiences leads people to condemn corrupt acts more strongly.",

         "Objective This open-trial study examined effects of a culturally-adapted Hebrew version of guided internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) for depression. We examined therapeutic alliance with the therapist and with the programme (content) as potential predictors of outcomes. Furthermore, we examined whether anxious and avoidant attachment styles improved, although relationships were not the focus of treatment. Method: We examined alliance with therapist and alliance with programme and their time-lagged (1 week), longitudinal relationship with depression outcomes, and change in anxious and avoidant attachment during treatment. Results: Depression and insomnia improved significantly (Cohen’s d: depression = 1.34, insomnia = 0.86), though dropout was relatively high (49%). Alliance with programme and with the therapist predicted adherence and dropout, whereas only alliance with therapist predicted symptom improvement. Avoidant attachment decreased over treatment whereas anxious attachment did not. Conclusion: A culturally-adapted version of ICBT for depression showed that alliance with therapist and alliance with programme both can play an important role in its effectiveness: alliance with programme and the therapist drive adherence and dropout and alliance with therapist is related to symptom improvement. Although the focus of treatment is not interpersonal, avoidant attachment style can improve following ICBT.",

         "Ansari, A R | Bayoumy, Ahmed B | De Boer, N K H | Florin, Timothy | Mulder, C J J | Schmiegelow, K",
         "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Thioguanine (TG), azathioprine (AZA), and mercaptopurine (MP) are thiopurine prodrugs commonly used to treat diseases, such as leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGNs) have been commonly used for monitoring treatment. High levels of 6-TGNs in red blood cells (RBCs) have been associated with leukopenia, the cutoff levels that predict this side effect remain uncertain. Thiopurines are metabolized and incorporated into leukocyte DNA. Measuring levels of DNA-incorporated thioguanine (DNA-TG) may be a more suitable method for predicting clinical response and toxicities such as leukopenia. Unfortunately, most methodologies to assay 6-TGNs are unable to identify the impact of NUDT15 variants, effecting mostly ethnic populations (e.g., Chinese, Indian, Malay, Japanese, and Hispanics). DNA-TG tackles this problem by directly measuring thioguanine in the DNA, which can be influenced by both TPMT and NUDT15 variants. While RBC 6-TGN concentrations have traditionally been used to optimize thiopurine therapy due to their ease and affordability of measurement, recent developments in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques have made measuring DNA-TG concentrations in lymphocytes accurate, reproducible, and affordable. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the current evidence of DNA-TG levels as marker for thiopurine therapy, especially with regards to NUDT15 variants.METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on the current evidence for DNA-TG as a marker for monitoring thiopurine therapy, including methods for measurement and the illustrative relationship between DNA-TG and various gene variants (such as TPMT, NUDT15, ITPA, NT5C2, and MRP4). PubMed and Embase were systematically searched up to April 2024 for published studies, using the keyword \"DNA-TG\" with MeSH terms and synonyms. The electronic search strategy was augmented by a manual examination of references cited in articles, recent reviews, editorials, and meta-analyses. A meta-analysis was performed using R studio 4.1.3. to investigate the difference between the coefficients (Fisher's z-transformed correlation coefficient) of DNA-TG and 6-TGNs levels. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan version 5.4 to investigate the difference in DNA-TG levels between patients with or without leukopenia using randomized effect size model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottowa quality assessment scale.RESULTS: In this systematic review, 21 studies were included that measured DNA-TG levels in white blood cells for either patients with ALL (n = 16) or IBD (n = 5). In our meta-analysis, the overall mean difference between patients with leukopenia (ALL + IBD) versus no leukopenia was 134.15 fmol TG/µg DNA [95% confidence interval (CI) (83.78-184.35), P < 0.00001; heterogeneity chi squared of 5.62, I2 of 47%]. There was a significant difference in DNA-TG levels for patients with IBD with and without leukopenia [161.76 fmol TG/µg DNA; 95% CI (126.23-197.29), P < 0.00001; heterogeneity chi squared of 0.20, I2 of 0%]. No significant difference was found in DNA-TG level between patients with ALL with or without leukopenia (57.71 fmol TG/µg DNA [95% CI (- 22.93 to 138.35), P < 0.80]). DNA-TG monitoring was found to be a promising method for predicting relapse rates in patients with ALL, and DNA-TG levels are likely a better predictor for leukopenia in patients with IBD than RBC 6-TGNs levels. DNA-TG levels have been shown to correlate with various gene variants (TPMT, NUDT15, ITPA, and MRP4) in various studies, points to its potential as a more informative marker for guiding thiopurine therapy across diverse genetic backgrounds.CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review strongly supports the further investigation of DNA-TG as a marker for monitoring thiopurine therapy. Its correlation with treatment outcomes, such as relapse-free survival in ALL and the risk of leukopenia in IBD, underscores its role in enhancing personalized treatment approaches. DNA-TG effectively identifies NUDT15 variants and predicts late leukopenia in patients with IBD, regardless of their NUDT15 variant status. The recommended threshold for late leukopenia prediction in patients with IBD with DNA-TG is suggested to be between 320 and 340 fmol/µg DNA. More clinical research on DNA-TG implementation is mandatory to improve patient care and to improve inclusivity in thiopurine treatment.",

         "BACKGROUND: Currently thioguanine is solely used as treatment for inflammatory bowel disease after azathioprine and/or mercaptopurine failure. This study aimed to determine the safety, effectiveness, and 12-month drug survival of thioguanine in thiopurine-naïve patients with inflammatory bowel disease.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in thiopurine-naïve patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with thioguanine as first thiopurine derivate. Clinical effectiveness was defined as the continuation of thioguanine without the (re)initiation of concurrent biological therapy, systemic corticosteroids, or a surgical intervention. All adverse events were categorized by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.RESULTS: A total of 114 patients (male 39%, Crohn's disease 53%) were included with a median treatment duration of 25 months and a median thioguanine dosage of 20 mg/d. Clinical effectiveness at 12 months was observed in 53% of patients, and 78% of these responding patients remained responsive until the end of follow-up. During the entire follow-up period, 26 patients were primary nonresponders, 8 had a secondary loss of response, and 11 patients were unable to cease therapy with systemic corticosteroids within 6 months and were therefore classified as nonresponders. After 12 months, thioguanine was still used by 86% of patients. Fifty (44%) patients developed adverse events (grade 1 or 2) and 9 (8%) patients ceased therapy due to the occurrence of adverse events. An infection was documented in 3 patients, none of them requiring hospitalization and pancytopenia occurred in 2 other patients. No signs of nodular regenerative hyperplasia or portal hypertension were observed.CONCLUSIONS: At 12 months, first-line thioguanine therapy was clinically effective in 53% of thiopurine-naïve inflammatory bowel disease patients with an acceptable safety profile.",

         "Boreal forests, covering more than half of the world's permafrost, are essential for maintaining permafrost stability. However, climate change and forest shifts are threatening the delicate balance in the thermal equilibrium between the atmosphere, vegetation, and permafrost. We focus on Central Yakutia's ice-rich boreal regions, specifically two sites located in Spasskaya-Pad and Churapcha, to investigate the interplay of hydrothermal and climatic conditions that induce thermokarst. We employ a numerical permafrost model (CryoGrid), with a canopy model, and features for excess ground ice, lateral water flow and lake formation, to simulate the underlying physical processes under two forcing scenarios until 2060. The results reveal that forest delays the onset of thermokarst and ground ice melting by 3–18&nbsp;years, depending on ice depth, climate forcing, and local conditions. Our simulations additionally reveal that a canopy slows excess ice melt by up to 7&nbsp;years compared to bare ground simulations. Furthermore, in exceptionally warm and wet years, thermokarst initiation occurred rapidly in the bare ground simulations. In contrast, the canopy buffered against these conditions, suggesting that canopies might mitigate the impacts of small temperature and precipitation anomalies. This research highlights the critical role of forests in shaping the trajectory of thermokarst-related landscape transformations in ice-rich boreal permafrost regions. With the study region warming faster than average, forest cover transformations could significantly alter the hydrological balance. By integrating thermodynamics, hydrology, and ecology, our findings underscore the importance of forests in delaying thermokarst initiation and slowing ground ice melt, ultimately stabilizing permafrost ecosystems.",

         "INTRODUCTION: Recent-onset colitis poses a diagnostic challenge, necessitating a thorough evaluation to identify potential infectious and non-infectious etiologies. We considered inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) secondary to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor-induced colitis.CASE PRESENTATION: This case report details the presentation and management of a patient with persistent dysentery, refractory to conventional treatments, ultimately attributed to IBD possibly secondary to long-term DPP-4 inhibitor use. Following an episode of suspected amebiasis, the patient experienced prolonged bloody diarrhea with an endoscopic image compatible with ulcerative colitis. Extensive infectious diagnostics were negative. Ultimately, the cessation of sitagliptin therapy resulted in rapid symptom resolution and normalization of eosinophilia, as well as endoscopic improvement. However, after a few weeks, the patient was readmitted with diarrhea after continued cessation of sitagliptin.CONCLUSION: This case underscores the importance of considering IBD secondary to DPP-4 inhibitor use in the evaluation of patients with recent-onset IBD. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the relationship between DPP-4 inhibitors and IBD.",

         "The introduction of biological therapies has revolutionized inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management. A critical consideration in developing these therapies is ensuring adequate drug concentrations at the site of action. While blood-based biomarkers have shown limited utility in optimizing treatment (except for TNF-alpha inhibitors and thiopurines), tissue drug concentrations may offer valuable insights. In antimicrobial therapies, tissue concentration monitoring is standard practice and could provide a new avenue for understanding the pharmacokinetics of biological and small-molecule therapies in IBD. Various methods exist for measuring tissue concentrations, including whole tissue sampling, MALDI-MSI, microdialysis, and fluorescent labeling. These techniques offer unique advantages, such as spatial drug-distribution mapping, continuous sampling, or cellular-level analysis. However, challenges remain, including sampling invasiveness, heterogeneity in tissue compartments, and a lack of standardized bioanalytical guidelines. Drug pharmacokinetics are influenced by multiple factors, including molecular properties, disease-induced changes in the gastrointestinal tract, and the timing of sample collection. For example, drug permeability, solubility, and interaction with transporters may vary between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Research into the tissue concentrations of drugs like anti-TNF agents, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and tofacitinib has shown variable correlations with clinical outcomes, suggesting potential roles for tissue concentration monitoring in therapeutic drug management. Although routine clinical application is not yet established, exploring tissue drug concentrations may enhance understanding of IBD pharmacotherapy.",

         "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that encompasses two major conditions: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Historically, IBD has been primarily reported in western countries, but over the past decades, its prevalence is rapidly increasing, especially in lower and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as India and China and also in Sub-Saharan Africa. The prevalence of IBD in LMICs has been the subject of growing concern due to the impact of access to public healthcare and the burden it places on healthcare resources. The classical thiopurines face significant challenges due to cessation of therapy in approximately half of patients within one year due to side effects or ineffectiveness. In this article, we highlight innovating thiopurine treatment for IBD patients in downregulating side effects and improving efficacy.",

         "Bayoumy, Ahmed B | de Ru, J Alexander",
         "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is an established treatment for acute acoustic trauma (AAT), with early intervention believed to improve hearing recovery. Evidence suggests that initiating HBOT within seven days of AAT onset results in superior hearing outcomes compared to later treatment. Linear regression models have estimated hearing improvements of approximately 24% and 14% for early (≤ 7 days) and late (> 7 days) treatment groups, respectively. In reanalyzing our own data using a similar model, we found that initiating HBOT within three days led to even greater recovery, with estimated improvements of 65% in the early (≤ 3 days) group and 43% in the late (> 3 days) group. While our results suggest a more pronounced benefit with earlier intervention, the lower R² values indicate greater variability in treatment response. Given that studies on idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) also support early treatment for optimal outcomes, we propose that HBOT for AAT should be initiated within three days for maximal benefit. Further investigation into this critical therapeutic window is warranted. If corroborating evidence supports a three-day threshold over seven days, it may be justified to consider both AAT and ISSHL as medical emergencies requiring immediate HBOT initiation.",

         "Background and objective: Diabetes is one of the four leading causes of death worldwide, necessitating daily blood glucose monitoring. While sweat offers a promising non-invasive alternative for glucose monitoring, its application remains limited due to the low to moderate correlation between sweat and blood glucose concentrations, which has been obtained until now by assuming a linear relationship. This study proposes a novel model-based strategy to estimate blood glucose concentrations from sweat samples, setting the stage for non-invasive glucose monitoring through sweat-sensing technology. Methods: We first developed a pharmacokinetic glucose transport model that describes the glucose transport from blood to sweat. Secondly, we designed a novel optimization strategy leveraging the proposed model to solve the inverse problem and infer blood glucose levels from measured glucose concentrations in sweat. To this end, the pharmacokinetic model parameters with the highest sensitivity were also optimized so as to achieve a personalized estimation. Our strategy was tested on a dataset composed of 108 samples from healthy volunteers and diabetic patients. Results: Our glucose transport model improves over the state-of-the-art in estimating sweat glucose concentrations from blood levels (higher accuracy, p<0.001). Additionally, our optimization strategy effectively solved the inverse problem, yielding a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.98 across all 108 data points, with an average root-mean-square-percent-error of 12%±8%. This significantly outperforms the best sweat-blood glucose correlation reported in the existing literature (0.75). Conclusion: Our innovative optimization strategy, also leveraging more accurate modeling, shows promising results, paving the way for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring and, possibly, improved diabetes management.",

         "Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is the replenishment of aquifers for environmental recovery or later use of the stored water. Under increasing occurrence of hydrological extremes, it shows great potential to buffer water availability. Nonetheless, these systems are affected by clogging, which decreases the infiltration rates over time. To deal with this issue and evaluate the potential to enhance recharge, we studied the effect of poplars (Populus Nigra predominantly) on two infiltration basins in a MAR system in central Spain, namely Santiuste (ST) and La Laguna del Señor (LS). The hypothesis is that plant roots can increase infiltration rates and counteract the effect of clogging through macropore formation and changes in soil characteristics. To this end, we conducted eight on-site infiltration test campaigns over two years in areas with and without trees, in addition to determining bulk density, organic carbon content and soil textures. We also built a 1-D vadose zone model and compared measured steady-state infiltration rates (SSIR) with theoretical values. When compared to bare soil, areas with trees show higher SSIR (37 % difference on average), higher organic carbon content (113 % difference on average), and lower bulk density (38 % difference on average). In all cases, measured SSIR values were larger than theoretical values, meaning that textures alone cannot explain local infiltration rates. Moreover, the difference between theoretical and measured SSIR is larger in trees than in bare soil by 40 % in ST and 198 % in LS. The 1-D vadose zone model shows that in the area studied, the transpiration by trees is largely offset by the additional recharge due to enhanced soil infiltration rates. These results suggest that trees increase infiltration rates, likely due to macropores and aggregate formation and the rearrangement of the soil structure. This nature-based solution could be extended to other MAR water-spreading methods and in-channel modifications.",

Apple prohibited Spotify to inform consumers about the option to get the app directly via Spotify and save at least 2 euros a month (>24 euro per year).

Sommige demonstranten bewandelen beide routes, politiek vertrouwen en effectiviteit zijn hoog, ze zijn politiek actief en tussen de verkiezingen door gaan ze de straat op. Andere demonstranten zijn zwaar teleurgesteld in de partij politiek, wantrouwen de politiek, ervaren onmacht, draaien partij politiek de rug toe en proberen via de straat invloed uit te oefenen.1 In beide gevallen wordt demonstreren ingezet als middel om politici en publieke opinie te beïnvloeden, maar ook om de beweging te laten groeien. Daarnaast biedt demonsteren een uitlaatklep, een ventiel voor maatschappelijke onrust. Kortom, onze democratische rechtsstaat moet ruimte bieden voor demonstraties, of zoals Eberhard van der Laan het enkele jaren geleden zei, het demonstratierecht is ‘bijkans heilig’.2",

         "The purinergic receptor P2Y12 (P2Y12R) is a well-recognized target for anti-thrombotic agents. This receptor is also expressed in microglia, the main immune cells of the brain, where it modulates microglial activation states and inflammatory responses. To investigate P2Y12R-mediated actions in the central nervous system (CNS), developing novel brain-penetrant ligands and further in vitro studies on brain tissues are essential. A radiolabeled, easily accessible tool compound would significantly advance such drug discovery efforts. Herein, we describe the 3H-labeling of a non-nucleotide P2Y12R antagonist AZ12464237, and its in vitro binding properties to the receptor in membrane preparations from transfected cells, as well as on mouse brain tissues. The radioligand shows high affinity toward both the human and rat P2Y12R, with Kd values of 3.12 ± 0.70 nM (human) and 16.6 ± 3.40 nM (rat), as determined by saturation binding studies. The binding kinetics of [3H]AZ12464237 are rapid with a short target residence time (∼1 min). We further confirmed the selectivity of the radioligand by performing competitive displacement studies, in which reported P2Y12R ligands and other P2Y receptors ligands were tested for binding against [3H]AZ12464237. Additionally, the radioligand proved valuable for in vitro autoradiography studies on mouse brain tissues, although limited off-target binding was observed in P2Y12R knock-out mouse brain. This could be traced to glycogen synthase kinase 3 α. Considering the growing interest in P2Y12R as a biomarker for anti-inflammatory microglia, [3H]AZ12464237 represents a promising tool for in vitro studies, including screening assays aimed at identifying novel P2Y12R ligands for CNS applications.",

         "This volume draws attention to different manifestations of marginality in mendicant studies. There is a long tradition of studying these religious orders, which took the late medieval landscape of monastic organizations in Europe by storm from the thirteenth century onward. Yet, as the introductory chapter by Małgorzata Krasnodębska-D’Aughton rightly highlights, this field remains characterised by significant areas of marginality—historiographical, geographical, and social—which this volume aims to cast fresh light on. After cogently identifying the study of Franciscans and Dominicans in Italy and France as the traditional “core” of mendicant studies, Krasnodębska-D’Aughton draws attention to the marginality of other mendicant orders, such as the Carmelites and Augustinians, as well as to the marginality of other geographical regions which have remained understudied by comparison. These areas, as well as the Carmelite and Augustinian orders, receive plenty of attention within this volume. In addressing the historiographical gaps identified, Ireland receives particular attention as a historiographical and geographical margin, alongside other European localities, such as Portugal and Lithuania.As the introductory chapter candidly states, the editors struggled to subdivide the chapters of the volume into sections on geographical, social, and historiographical margins, since most of the chapters address more than one type of marginality. The division into three sections does, therefore, feel somewhat artificial, except perhaps for the first two chapters in the section on social margins (on female religious in Florence and Ireland). Indeed, the division into sections could perhaps have been dispensed with altogether, only to further highlight the high degree to which these papers do speak to each other: thematic coherence across the volume is outstanding. A further strength commonly shared across the different chapters is that each very accessibly presents material from less well-known historiographical traditions or geographical margins, without assuming prior knowledge from the reader. This is indeed a crucial feature for a volume that aims to address margins: to break down historiographical and linguistic boundaries, allowing a wider audience to engage. No matter if the development of the Augustinian order and its origins, or the distribution of female branches of the Franciscan order in Ireland, is unfamiliar territory to the reader, the essays in this volume simultaneously take one by the hand, while offering in-depth case studies.Mendicants on the Margins reflects the interdisciplinary nature of mendicant studies. The contributions range across art historical, architectural and historiographical topics. It is beyond the scope of this review to cover the content of all the chapters in the volume, which vary somewhat in length and analytical depth; however, I would like to particularly highlight the excellent essays by Sophie Delmas, Catherine Lawless, and Anne-Julie Lafaye by way of offering a sampling of the volume’s contents.In her essay, Sophie Delmas engages with the traditional scholarly focus on mendicant orders as part and parcel of late medieval urban development. This has diverted attention away from friaries situated in the countryside, as she argues in her analysis of mendicant friaries along the fringes of the French coastline. Her analysis of the observant Franciscan “conversion to the sea” on certain French islands is particularly enlightening on how these mendicants adapted to their environment, both from an ideological as well as from a practical point of view: in their insular seclusion the friars engaged in salt production and exploited fisheries.While social marginalities, including gender, race and ethnicity, overall receive somewhat less attention in Mendicants on the Margins than geographical and historiographical marginality, these themes are taken up in the fascinating paper by Catherine Lawless on penitent women in Florence. After drawing attention to the marginality of female saints in the iconography of Florentine mendicant churches, Lawless brings into focus an even more invisible and marginal group of women, the secular female penitents living in houses close to monumental mendicant churches, looking to the friars for spiritual guidance. In the same section on social marginalities, Anne-Julie Lafaye masterfully complicates the seeming marginal, rural setting of Augustinian houses, by studying the ruined remains of Augustinian friaries in Ireland, and using architectural evidence to point out the centrality of these convents with respect to the communities which they served.The final two chapters of the volume implicitly draw attention to a further case of marginality in mendicant studies which is not addressed explicitly by the volume: the study of mendicant orders during the early modern period in Europe. This indeed points to one of the main qualities of this volume: it invites scholars to reflect more attentively on margins and marginalities in the study of mendicant orders, concerning which this reviewer learned a great deal.",

         "Many software businesses face increasing regulatory pressure and requirements changes that target more sustainable software systems. Therefore, integrating sustainability into software architecture is crucial for the long-term viability of organizations. In this study, we explore how new sustainability concerns can be effectively tackled within software architecture, especially when established architecture standards are followed. We present two main contributions derived from an industrial case study. First, we present the extension of existing architecture views, called decision maps, to trace the involvement of architecture standards. Such extension supports architects through informed decision making by integrating sustainability aspects while adhering to architecture standards. Second, we propose a set of key performance indicators to monitor the ongoing application of these standards and assess their impact on the software architecture and its sustainability over time. Our findings provide valuable insights and instruments for experts to first assess sustainability within the constraints of architecture standards, and then monitor their sustainability impact. This will help to meet regulatory requirements and align software design with strategic sustainability goals. We provide tangible guiding steps to improve sustainability awareness and decision-making.",

The analysis of an online-survey of 1,776 works councillors reveals differences and similarities between the two countries. Despite very similar institutional settings, multivariate statistical analysis shows that works councils differ in the priorities they set when choosing a preferred partner. German worker representatives feel close to the unions and workforce alike, while their Dutch counterparts maintain comparatively close relations to management. Nevertheless, we see many similarities as well. So, despite different historical trajectories and differences in regulatory detail, works councils have much in common in both countries, which suggests that they have a systematic impact on how employee voice materialises on the ground.",

         "Neurons in cortical networks are very sparsely connected; even neurons whose axons and dendrites overlap are highly unlikely to form a synaptic connection. What is the relevance of such sparse connectivity for a network’s function? Surprisingly, it has been shown that sparse connectivity impairs information processing in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Does this imply that sparse connectivity also impairs information processing in biological neural networks? Although ANNs were originally inspired by the brain, conventional ANNs differ substantially in their structural network architecture from cortical networks. To disentangle the relevance of these structural properties for information processing in networks, we systematically constructed ANNs constrained by interpretable features of cortical networks. We find that in large and recurrently connected networks, as are found in the cortex, sparse connectivity facilitates time- and data-efficient information processing. We explore the origins of these surprising findings and show that conventional dense ANNs distribute information across only a very small fraction of nodes, whereas sparse ANNs distribute information across more nodes. We show that sparsity is most critical in networks with fixed excitatory and inhibitory nodes, mirroring neuronal cell types in cortex. This constraint causes a large learning delay in densely connected networks which is eliminated by sparse connectivity. Taken together, our findings show that sparse connectivity enables efficient information processing given key constraints from cortical networks, setting the stage for further investigation into higher-order features of cortical connectivity.",

         "The proliferation of renewable energy contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals but also leads to waste issues and critical raw material dependencies. It is therefore important to study circular economy (CE) strategies for renewables to mitigate these challenges, while ensuring broad social participation and enhancing community and business resilience. We apply market failure and cooperative theory to explore how cooperative governance can enable and embed circularity in smart grids. Using a case study of a smart grid project in Belgium, we identify key barriers and enablers for fostering circular outcomes. Our findings suggest that cooperative governance can mitigate market failures involved, such as split incentives and asymmetric information, resolving missing markets and facilitating the integration of CE strategies in smart grids. Analysing design-implementation gaps and boundary conditions for scaling and replication highlights the importance of overcoming regulatory barriers and engaging stakeholders through compelling value propositions. While cooperatives are a promising model for advancing sustainable energy transitions, they require regulatory support and community involvement to realise their full potential. Smart grid development may be shaped by regional institutional contexts but the insights on cooperatives derived from this study have a broad international relevance given the globally applied and comparable framework employed.",

         "T his article offers a speculative reading of the Schleitheim Articles’ argument on the “sword” in its sixth article. It argues that Schleitheim’s argument is more concerned with the political logic of the church than with ethical rules individual Christians are to obey. T he “sword” does not refer to violence in general but specifically to a particular logic of political domination. Seemingly anticipating modern discussions, this logic functions by making a distinction between lives: the “wicked” and the “good,” those that are protected and those lives given up to death. Although such authority can be legitimate, Schleitheim argues the church should strive to build communities that break with that logic, in emulation of Christ’s non-sovereign character. In the church, the theopolitical image of God as one who “ordains” is to be unlearned. The relationship between the two incompatible orders of sword and church remains underdetermined, giving rise to a wide spectrum of possible interactions and interminable negotiation.",

         "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as cathelicidins, show dual functionality by directly combating pathogens and indirectly eliminating them through stimulation of the immune system, generating interest in their therapeutic potential. Pigs have a large set of 11 cathelicidins, of which PMAP-37 is relatively understudied compared to some of the better-known cathelicidins. This study describes the effectiveness of PMAP-37 against both bacteria and viruses. PMAP-37 exhibited potent in vitro antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus globigii) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) with minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of 2.5 and 5 μM, respectively. PMAP-37 caused a rapid permeabilization of E. coli's outer and inner membranes within 5 min, indicating its efficacy in disrupting bacterial cell membranes. Furthermore, PMAP-37 neutralized nitric oxide production in a macrophage celline stimulated with various forms of LPS, LIPID A, or LTA in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed PMAP-37's capacity to inhibit LPS binding to macrophages, while zeta potential analysis showed the peptide's capacity to neutralize the negative charge of both the E. coli membrane and LPS micellular surfaces. Interestingly PMAP-37 also exhibited antiviral activity against an important porcine pathogen, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). These findings underscore the multifunctional properties of PMAP-37, and provides potential leads for future therapeutic use within the pig industry.",

         "Impaired neuronal and synaptic function are hallmarks of early Alzheimer's disease (AD), preceding other neuropathological traits and cognitive decline. We previously showed that SFRP1, a glial-derived protein elevated in AD brains from preclinical stages, contributes to disease progression, implicating glial factors in early pathogenesis. Here, we generate and analyze transgenic mice overexpressing astrocytic SFRP1. SFRP1 accumulation causes early dendritic and synaptic defects in adult mice, followed by impaired synaptic long-term potentiation and cognitive decline, evident only when the animals age, thereby mimicking AD's structural-functional temporal distinction. This phenotype correlates with proteomic changes, including increased structural synaptic proteins like neurexin, which localizes in close proximity with SFRP1 in cultured hippocampal neurons. We conclude that excessive SFRP1 hinders synaptic protein turnover, reducing synaptic plasticity—a mechanism that may underlie the synaptopathy observed in the brains of prodromal AD patients.",

         "Acting intentionally requires the integration of perceptual with action information in a common representational format. In the action control literature, this integrated representation is often called event file and is measured in so-called stimulus-response binding effects. These effects allow us to measure the strength of this shared representation and the impact it can have on behavior. A well-established finding is that particular variables can modulate the size of binding effects – one recently discovered modulator is stimulus predictability: If perceptual information is perfectly predictable, stimulus-response binding effects diminish. Yet, the concrete mechanism of why predictability diminishes stimulus-response binding effects remained elusive so far. In the present study (N = 234), we compared two possible explanations for these modulation effects, namely habituation versus statistical learning. We found that it is unlikely that the predictability modulation is explained by habituation. Instead, we found evidence that is more in line with (but not exclusive to) learning of statistical regularities as an explanation. Our study thus adds to recent attempts to more closely relate learning mechanisms and action control.",

         "The landscape-scale impacts of habitat subdivision (fragmentation per se) on biodiversity are not fully resolved. While smaller patches usually contain more species for equal total area, many implications of this remain unclear. For example, do equal areas of smaller and larger patches provide equivalent habitat value? How might this change over time and under differing matrix conditions? To help address these knowledge gaps, we developed an indicator of relative habitat value based on a species-individual null model. We used the indicator to compare sets of patches ordered in small-to-large and large-to-small orders, building hierarchical Bayesian regression models to test the role of time since patch creation and contrasting matrix conditions. This allowed us to assess habitat value for 85 metacommunities inhabiting fragmented landscapes (1354 patches, >4500 species). We expected comparable habitat value following patch creation due to unpaid extinction debts, and the matrix would determine the direction of change over time, a harsher matrix increasing the relative value of larger patches. Averaged over time and matrix quality, the indicator probability density was mostly negative, suggesting slightly greater habitat value among larger patches. This pattern was consistent across taxonomic groups, although amphibians and reptiles were the most affected, and invertebrates least so. Larger patches were of greater value within 20 years of patch creation, but over time smaller patches increased in value under any matrix type, whereas value remained constant for larger patches. Matrix conditions mediated the relative difference: after 100 years under a light matrix, patches of all sizes were essentially of equivalent value, while larger patches were still favoured under a harsh matrix. Policy implications. In long-fragmented, light matrix landscapes, small and large patches apparently offer comparable per-unit-area habitat value. Conversely, under a harsh matrix, larger patches retain slightly greater habitat value. We speculate that this reflects a ‘colonization credit’, which might occur within smaller patches after the initial loss of fragmentation-sensitive species in disturbed landscapes. Overall, analyses support the need to maintain and enhance total habitat area—regardless of configuration—for biodiversity conservation, especially in long-fragmented landscapes with light matrices.",

         "Purpose: This exploratory research aims to unravel how Chinese international students form their decisions regarding the school-to-work transition (sometimes also referred to as the university-to-work transition) when studying abroad. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the concepts of school-to-work transition and cultural approaches to investigate how Chinese graduate students make career decisions to navigate the school-to-work transition in the context of international mobility. The authors' empirical study is based on 30 semi-structured interviews conducted with Chinese graduate students studying in the Netherlands. Findings: The authors discovered four patterns with two major subgroups among Chinese students studying in the universities in the Netherlands based on their initial intentions: return-return, open-return, open-stay and stay-stay. These patterns made sense when navigating the school-to-work transition: participants experienced varied international experiences, cultural perceptions and acknowledgment influences when enhancing employability and shaping their career decisions. Participants in the return-return and stay-stay groups indicated strong resilience and consistency in achieving their goals and strongly focused on long-term objectives. However, participants' open-return decision demonstrated a thoughtful alignment of personal goals and knowledge of the possible beneficial influence they may have in their home country. Open-stay participants utilized the overseas study opportunity to finalize their decisions and increase their employability in the local labor market, thereby creating a transition from university to work in the host country. Originality/value: The authors highlight the way Chinese graduate students manage their international experience and provide novel insights into the role played by the cultural characteristics of their home country and host country.",

         "This book examines the Indo-Surinamese Girmitiya peasants and their contributions to developing the ethnic community within their newly adopted home. It demonstrates the transformation of the Girmitiyas from agriculturalists in British India to plantation labourers to peasants and finally to urban dwellers. The author argues that it was the Girmitiya peasants who had made greater contributions to developing the ethnic community over the labourers of whom about one-third returned to British India. The work covers the history of how the peasants institutionalised their practice, changed the physical landscape and integrated economically and politically as an ethnic group in their newly adopted homeland. Furthermore, the author presents arguments to demonstrate that Girmitiya peasants survived the plantation labour and peasant life due to their knowledge and skills of agrarian cultivation, known as agrarian human capital. The scholarly literature about the labour migration from British India has focused heavily on the fate of the labourers. Consequently, the history of the Girmitiya peasants as well as the cultural heritage they have produced has been grossly neglected. This book purports to fill this void by telling the history of Girmitiya peasants in Suriname, a Caribbean society adjacent to former British Guyana.",

         "Question Mental health complaints are increased in survivors of natural hazards and disaster responders. This meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of psychological and psychosocial interventions for the prevention of mental disorders after exposure to natural hazards. Study selection and analysis We searched Web of Science, PsycINFO and MEDLINE for peer-reviewed randomised controlled trials evaluating preventive interventions targeting symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. Trials conducted in both, civilians and disaster responders, were included. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted to assess the efficacy of interventions relative to active and passive control conditions. Findings The results from 10 included studies (5068 participants) did not find preventive interventions to be superior compared with active or passive control conditions regarding symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (g=0.08 and g=0.05) and depression (g=0.13 and g=0.32, respectively). Effects on anxiety symptoms remain unclear. Aggregated effects for all outcomes were significant at follow-up compared with passive controls, but the interpretability is limited by the low number of studies. Intervention effects were not significantly associated with intervention type (psychotherapy vs psychosocial), age or delivery mode (online vs face-to-face). The risk of bias across studies was high. Conclusions The current evidence does not allow for any recommendations regarding prevention programmes in the aftermath of natural hazards. A larger body of high-quality research is needed to develop effective and evidence-based preventive interventions for disaster survivors and responders. Study registration https://osf.io/4es65.",

         "Extant research on corruption has uncovered the important role of norms. Yet, little is known about how people view specific acts of corruption in countries that differ in the prevalence of corruption. The present research examines moral judgements of four different types of corrupt acts in a high- versus low-corruption country, thereby providing a critical test of two opposing hypotheses. The descriptive norms approach predicts that citizens of a high-corruption country will be morally more lenient than citizens of a low-corruption country. The relative deprivation approach predicts the opposite, that citizens of a high-corruption country will morally condemn corrupt acts stronger than citizens of a low-corruption country. Drawing samples from the Netherlands and Indonesia (a low- vs. high-corruption country), two experiments (total N = 477) show that Dutch participants are often more morally permissive towards corruption than Indonesians, although specific results varied for the four types of corruption. This largely supported the relative deprivation approach. In addition, Indonesian participants expressed more disappointment and anger towards corruption than Dutch participants. This research suggests that feeling deprived through regular corruption experiences leads people to condemn corrupt acts more strongly.",

         "Objective This open-trial study examined effects of a culturally-adapted Hebrew version of guided internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) for depression. We examined therapeutic alliance with the therapist and with the programme (content) as potential predictors of outcomes. Furthermore, we examined whether anxious and avoidant attachment styles improved, although relationships were not the focus of treatment. Method: We examined alliance with therapist and alliance with programme and their time-lagged (1 week), longitudinal relationship with depression outcomes, and change in anxious and avoidant attachment during treatment. Results: Depression and insomnia improved significantly (Cohen’s d: depression = 1.34, insomnia = 0.86), though dropout was relatively high (49%). Alliance with programme and with the therapist predicted adherence and dropout, whereas only alliance with therapist predicted symptom improvement. Avoidant attachment decreased over treatment whereas anxious attachment did not. Conclusion: A culturally-adapted version of ICBT for depression showed that alliance with therapist and alliance with programme both can play an important role in its effectiveness: alliance with programme and the therapist drive adherence and dropout and alliance with therapist is related to symptom improvement. Although the focus of treatment is not interpersonal, avoidant attachment style can improve following ICBT.",

         "Ansari, A R | Bayoumy, Ahmed B | De Boer, N K H | Florin, Timothy | Mulder, C J J | Schmiegelow, K",
         "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Thioguanine (TG), azathioprine (AZA), and mercaptopurine (MP) are thiopurine prodrugs commonly used to treat diseases, such as leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGNs) have been commonly used for monitoring treatment. High levels of 6-TGNs in red blood cells (RBCs) have been associated with leukopenia, the cutoff levels that predict this side effect remain uncertain. Thiopurines are metabolized and incorporated into leukocyte DNA. Measuring levels of DNA-incorporated thioguanine (DNA-TG) may be a more suitable method for predicting clinical response and toxicities such as leukopenia. Unfortunately, most methodologies to assay 6-TGNs are unable to identify the impact of NUDT15 variants, effecting mostly ethnic populations (e.g., Chinese, Indian, Malay, Japanese, and Hispanics). DNA-TG tackles this problem by directly measuring thioguanine in the DNA, which can be influenced by both TPMT and NUDT15 variants. While RBC 6-TGN concentrations have traditionally been used to optimize thiopurine therapy due to their ease and affordability of measurement, recent developments in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques have made measuring DNA-TG concentrations in lymphocytes accurate, reproducible, and affordable. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the current evidence of DNA-TG levels as marker for thiopurine therapy, especially with regards to NUDT15 variants.METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on the current evidence for DNA-TG as a marker for monitoring thiopurine therapy, including methods for measurement and the illustrative relationship between DNA-TG and various gene variants (such as TPMT, NUDT15, ITPA, NT5C2, and MRP4). PubMed and Embase were systematically searched up to April 2024 for published studies, using the keyword \"DNA-TG\" with MeSH terms and synonyms. The electronic search strategy was augmented by a manual examination of references cited in articles, recent reviews, editorials, and meta-analyses. A meta-analysis was performed using R studio 4.1.3. to investigate the difference between the coefficients (Fisher's z-transformed correlation coefficient) of DNA-TG and 6-TGNs levels. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan version 5.4 to investigate the difference in DNA-TG levels between patients with or without leukopenia using randomized effect size model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottowa quality assessment scale.RESULTS: In this systematic review, 21 studies were included that measured DNA-TG levels in white blood cells for either patients with ALL (n = 16) or IBD (n = 5). In our meta-analysis, the overall mean difference between patients with leukopenia (ALL + IBD) versus no leukopenia was 134.15 fmol TG/µg DNA [95% confidence interval (CI) (83.78-184.35), P < 0.00001; heterogeneity chi squared of 5.62, I2 of 47%]. There was a significant difference in DNA-TG levels for patients with IBD with and without leukopenia [161.76 fmol TG/µg DNA; 95% CI (126.23-197.29), P < 0.00001; heterogeneity chi squared of 0.20, I2 of 0%]. No significant difference was found in DNA-TG level between patients with ALL with or without leukopenia (57.71 fmol TG/µg DNA [95% CI (- 22.93 to 138.35), P < 0.80]). DNA-TG monitoring was found to be a promising method for predicting relapse rates in patients with ALL, and DNA-TG levels are likely a better predictor for leukopenia in patients with IBD than RBC 6-TGNs levels. DNA-TG levels have been shown to correlate with various gene variants (TPMT, NUDT15, ITPA, and MRP4) in various studies, points to its potential as a more informative marker for guiding thiopurine therapy across diverse genetic backgrounds.CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review strongly supports the further investigation of DNA-TG as a marker for monitoring thiopurine therapy. Its correlation with treatment outcomes, such as relapse-free survival in ALL and the risk of leukopenia in IBD, underscores its role in enhancing personalized treatment approaches. DNA-TG effectively identifies NUDT15 variants and predicts late leukopenia in patients with IBD, regardless of their NUDT15 variant status. The recommended threshold for late leukopenia prediction in patients with IBD with DNA-TG is suggested to be between 320 and 340 fmol/µg DNA. More clinical research on DNA-TG implementation is mandatory to improve patient care and to improve inclusivity in thiopurine treatment.",

         "BACKGROUND: Currently thioguanine is solely used as treatment for inflammatory bowel disease after azathioprine and/or mercaptopurine failure. This study aimed to determine the safety, effectiveness, and 12-month drug survival of thioguanine in thiopurine-naïve patients with inflammatory bowel disease.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in thiopurine-naïve patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with thioguanine as first thiopurine derivate. Clinical effectiveness was defined as the continuation of thioguanine without the (re)initiation of concurrent biological therapy, systemic corticosteroids, or a surgical intervention. All adverse events were categorized by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.RESULTS: A total of 114 patients (male 39%, Crohn's disease 53%) were included with a median treatment duration of 25 months and a median thioguanine dosage of 20 mg/d. Clinical effectiveness at 12 months was observed in 53% of patients, and 78% of these responding patients remained responsive until the end of follow-up. During the entire follow-up period, 26 patients were primary nonresponders, 8 had a secondary loss of response, and 11 patients were unable to cease therapy with systemic corticosteroids within 6 months and were therefore classified as nonresponders. After 12 months, thioguanine was still used by 86% of patients. Fifty (44%) patients developed adverse events (grade 1 or 2) and 9 (8%) patients ceased therapy due to the occurrence of adverse events. An infection was documented in 3 patients, none of them requiring hospitalization and pancytopenia occurred in 2 other patients. No signs of nodular regenerative hyperplasia or portal hypertension were observed.CONCLUSIONS: At 12 months, first-line thioguanine therapy was clinically effective in 53% of thiopurine-naïve inflammatory bowel disease patients with an acceptable safety profile.",

         "Boreal forests, covering more than half of the world's permafrost, are essential for maintaining permafrost stability. However, climate change and forest shifts are threatening the delicate balance in the thermal equilibrium between the atmosphere, vegetation, and permafrost. We focus on Central Yakutia's ice-rich boreal regions, specifically two sites located in Spasskaya-Pad and Churapcha, to investigate the interplay of hydrothermal and climatic conditions that induce thermokarst. We employ a numerical permafrost model (CryoGrid), with a canopy model, and features for excess ground ice, lateral water flow and lake formation, to simulate the underlying physical processes under two forcing scenarios until 2060. The results reveal that forest delays the onset of thermokarst and ground ice melting by 3–18&nbsp;years, depending on ice depth, climate forcing, and local conditions. Our simulations additionally reveal that a canopy slows excess ice melt by up to 7&nbsp;years compared to bare ground simulations. Furthermore, in exceptionally warm and wet years, thermokarst initiation occurred rapidly in the bare ground simulations. In contrast, the canopy buffered against these conditions, suggesting that canopies might mitigate the impacts of small temperature and precipitation anomalies. This research highlights the critical role of forests in shaping the trajectory of thermokarst-related landscape transformations in ice-rich boreal permafrost regions. With the study region warming faster than average, forest cover transformations could significantly alter the hydrological balance. By integrating thermodynamics, hydrology, and ecology, our findings underscore the importance of forests in delaying thermokarst initiation and slowing ground ice melt, ultimately stabilizing permafrost ecosystems.",

         "INTRODUCTION: Recent-onset colitis poses a diagnostic challenge, necessitating a thorough evaluation to identify potential infectious and non-infectious etiologies. We considered inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) secondary to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor-induced colitis.CASE PRESENTATION: This case report details the presentation and management of a patient with persistent dysentery, refractory to conventional treatments, ultimately attributed to IBD possibly secondary to long-term DPP-4 inhibitor use. Following an episode of suspected amebiasis, the patient experienced prolonged bloody diarrhea with an endoscopic image compatible with ulcerative colitis. Extensive infectious diagnostics were negative. Ultimately, the cessation of sitagliptin therapy resulted in rapid symptom resolution and normalization of eosinophilia, as well as endoscopic improvement. However, after a few weeks, the patient was readmitted with diarrhea after continued cessation of sitagliptin.CONCLUSION: This case underscores the importance of considering IBD secondary to DPP-4 inhibitor use in the evaluation of patients with recent-onset IBD. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the relationship between DPP-4 inhibitors and IBD.",

         "The introduction of biological therapies has revolutionized inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management. A critical consideration in developing these therapies is ensuring adequate drug concentrations at the site of action. While blood-based biomarkers have shown limited utility in optimizing treatment (except for TNF-alpha inhibitors and thiopurines), tissue drug concentrations may offer valuable insights. In antimicrobial therapies, tissue concentration monitoring is standard practice and could provide a new avenue for understanding the pharmacokinetics of biological and small-molecule therapies in IBD. Various methods exist for measuring tissue concentrations, including whole tissue sampling, MALDI-MSI, microdialysis, and fluorescent labeling. These techniques offer unique advantages, such as spatial drug-distribution mapping, continuous sampling, or cellular-level analysis. However, challenges remain, including sampling invasiveness, heterogeneity in tissue compartments, and a lack of standardized bioanalytical guidelines. Drug pharmacokinetics are influenced by multiple factors, including molecular properties, disease-induced changes in the gastrointestinal tract, and the timing of sample collection. For example, drug permeability, solubility, and interaction with transporters may vary between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Research into the tissue concentrations of drugs like anti-TNF agents, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and tofacitinib has shown variable correlations with clinical outcomes, suggesting potential roles for tissue concentration monitoring in therapeutic drug management. Although routine clinical application is not yet established, exploring tissue drug concentrations may enhance understanding of IBD pharmacotherapy.",

Historically, IBD has been primarily reported in western countries, but over the past decades, its prevalence is rapidly increasing, especially in lower and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as India and China and also in Sub-Saharan Africa. The prevalence of IBD in LMICs has been the subject of growing concern due to the impact of access to public healthcare and the burden it places on healthcare resources. The classical thiopurines face significant challenges due to cessation of therapy in approximately half of patients within one year due to side effects or ineffectiveness.

         "Bayoumy, Ahmed B | de Ru, J Alexander",
         "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is an established treatment for acute acoustic trauma (AAT), with early intervention believed to improve hearing recovery. Evidence suggests that initiating HBOT within seven days of AAT onset results in superior hearing outcomes compared to later treatment. Linear regression models have estimated hearing improvements of approximately 24% and 14% for early (≤ 7 days) and late (> 7 days) treatment groups, respectively. In reanalyzing our own data using a similar model, we found that initiating HBOT within three days led to even greater recovery, with estimated improvements of 65% in the early (≤ 3 days) group and 43% in the late (> 3 days) group. While our results suggest a more pronounced benefit with earlier intervention, the lower R² values indicate greater variability in treatment response. Given that studies on idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) also support early treatment for optimal outcomes, we propose that HBOT for AAT should be initiated within three days for maximal benefit. Further investigation into this critical therapeutic window is warranted. If corroborating evidence supports a three-day threshold over seven days, it may be justified to consider both AAT and ISSHL as medical emergencies requiring immediate HBOT initiation.",

         "Background and objective: Diabetes is one of the four leading causes of death worldwide, necessitating daily blood glucose monitoring. While sweat offers a promising non-invasive alternative for glucose monitoring, its application remains limited due to the low to moderate correlation between sweat and blood glucose concentrations, which has been obtained until now by assuming a linear relationship. This study proposes a novel model-based strategy to estimate blood glucose concentrations from sweat samples, setting the stage for non-invasive glucose monitoring through sweat-sensing technology. Methods: We first developed a pharmacokinetic glucose transport model that describes the glucose transport from blood to sweat. Secondly, we designed a novel optimization strategy leveraging the proposed model to solve the inverse problem and infer blood glucose levels from measured glucose concentrations in sweat. To this end, the pharmacokinetic model parameters with the highest sensitivity were also optimized so as to achieve a personalized estimation. Our strategy was tested on a dataset composed of 108 samples from healthy volunteers and diabetic patients. Results: Our glucose transport model improves over the state-of-the-art in estimating sweat glucose concentrations from blood levels (higher accuracy, p<0.001). Additionally, our optimization strategy effectively solved the inverse problem, yielding a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.98 across all 108 data points, with an average root-mean-square-percent-error of 12%±8%. This significantly outperforms the best sweat-blood glucose correlation reported in the existing literature (0.75). Conclusion: Our innovative optimization strategy, also leveraging more accurate modeling, shows promising results, paving the way for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring and, possibly, improved diabetes management.",

         "Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is the replenishment of aquifers for environmental recovery or later use of the stored water. Under increasing occurrence of hydrological extremes, it shows great potential to buffer water availability. Nonetheless, these systems are affected by clogging, which decreases the infiltration rates over time. To deal with this issue and evaluate the potential to enhance recharge, we studied the effect of poplars (Populus Nigra predominantly) on two infiltration basins in a MAR system in central Spain, namely Santiuste (ST) and La Laguna del Señor (LS). The hypothesis is that plant roots can increase infiltration rates and counteract the effect of clogging through macropore formation and changes in soil characteristics. To this end, we conducted eight on-site infiltration test campaigns over two years in areas with and without trees, in addition to determining bulk density, organic carbon content and soil textures. We also built a 1-D vadose zone model and compared measured steady-state infiltration rates (SSIR) with theoretical values. When compared to bare soil, areas with trees show higher SSIR (37 % difference on average), higher organic carbon content (113 % difference on average), and lower bulk density (38 % difference on average). In all cases, measured SSIR values were larger than theoretical values, meaning that textures alone cannot explain local infiltration rates. Moreover, the difference between theoretical and measured SSIR is larger in trees than in bare soil by 40 % in ST and 198 % in LS. The 1-D vadose zone model shows that in the area studied, the transpiration by trees is largely offset by the additional recharge due to enhanced soil infiltration rates. These results suggest that trees increase infiltration rates, likely due to macropores and aggregate formation and the rearrangement of the soil structure. This nature-based solution could be extended to other MAR water-spreading methods and in-channel modifications.",

My first reaction was: why would someone do that? Why pay 30% more monthly via Apple, if you would not have to pay this extra 30% if you got a subscription directly via Spotify? A possible answer is that the user was not aware of the possibility of getting the app directly via Spotify, instead of via the App Store. Apple prohibited Spotify to inform consumers about the option to get the app directly via Spotify and save at least 2 euros a month (>24 euro per year). The case centers around this practice, Apple’s prohibition to Spotify to inform, which is qualified by the Commission as “imposing unfair trading conditions” cf. Article 102(a) TFEU.

         "The purinergic receptor P2Y12 (P2Y12R) is a well-recognized target for anti-thrombotic agents. This receptor is also expressed in microglia, the main immune cells of the brain, where it modulates microglial activation states and inflammatory responses. To investigate P2Y12R-mediated actions in the central nervous system (CNS), developing novel brain-penetrant ligands and further in vitro studies on brain tissues are essential. A radiolabeled, easily accessible tool compound would significantly advance such drug discovery efforts. Herein, we describe the 3H-labeling of a non-nucleotide P2Y12R antagonist AZ12464237, and its in vitro binding properties to the receptor in membrane preparations from transfected cells, as well as on mouse brain tissues. The radioligand shows high affinity toward both the human and rat P2Y12R, with Kd values of 3.12 ± 0.70 nM (human) and 16.6 ± 3.40 nM (rat), as determined by saturation binding studies. The binding kinetics of [3H]AZ12464237 are rapid with a short target residence time (∼1 min). We further confirmed the selectivity of the radioligand by performing competitive displacement studies, in which reported P2Y12R ligands and other P2Y receptors ligands were tested for binding against [3H]AZ12464237. Additionally, the radioligand proved valuable for in vitro autoradiography studies on mouse brain tissues, although limited off-target binding was observed in P2Y12R knock-out mouse brain. This could be traced to glycogen synthase kinase 3 α. Considering the growing interest in P2Y12R as a biomarker for anti-inflammatory microglia, [3H]AZ12464237 represents a promising tool for in vitro studies, including screening assays aimed at identifying novel P2Y12R ligands for CNS applications.",

         "This volume draws attention to different manifestations of marginality in mendicant studies. There is a long tradition of studying these religious orders, which took the late medieval landscape of monastic organizations in Europe by storm from the thirteenth century onward. Yet, as the introductory chapter by Małgorzata Krasnodębska-D’Aughton rightly highlights, this field remains characterised by significant areas of marginality—historiographical, geographical, and social—which this volume aims to cast fresh light on. After cogently identifying the study of Franciscans and Dominicans in Italy and France as the traditional “core” of mendicant studies, Krasnodębska-D’Aughton draws attention to the marginality of other mendicant orders, such as the Carmelites and Augustinians, as well as to the marginality of other geographical regions which have remained understudied by comparison. These areas, as well as the Carmelite and Augustinian orders, receive plenty of attention within this volume. In addressing the historiographical gaps identified, Ireland receives particular attention as a historiographical and geographical margin, alongside other European localities, such as Portugal and Lithuania.As the introductory chapter candidly states, the editors struggled to subdivide the chapters of the volume into sections on geographical, social, and historiographical margins, since most of the chapters address more than one type of marginality. The division into three sections does, therefore, feel somewhat artificial, except perhaps for the first two chapters in the section on social margins (on female religious in Florence and Ireland). Indeed, the division into sections could perhaps have been dispensed with altogether, only to further highlight the high degree to which these papers do speak to each other: thematic coherence across the volume is outstanding. A further strength commonly shared across the different chapters is that each very accessibly presents material from less well-known historiographical traditions or geographical margins, without assuming prior knowledge from the reader. This is indeed a crucial feature for a volume that aims to address margins: to break down historiographical and linguistic boundaries, allowing a wider audience to engage. No matter if the development of the Augustinian order and its origins, or the distribution of female branches of the Franciscan order in Ireland, is unfamiliar territory to the reader, the essays in this volume simultaneously take one by the hand, while offering in-depth case studies.Mendicants on the Margins reflects the interdisciplinary nature of mendicant studies. The contributions range across art historical, architectural and historiographical topics. It is beyond the scope of this review to cover the content of all the chapters in the volume, which vary somewhat in length and analytical depth; however, I would like to particularly highlight the excellent essays by Sophie Delmas, Catherine Lawless, and Anne-Julie Lafaye by way of offering a sampling of the volume’s contents.In her essay, Sophie Delmas engages with the traditional scholarly focus on mendicant orders as part and parcel of late medieval urban development. This has diverted attention away from friaries situated in the countryside, as she argues in her analysis of mendicant friaries along the fringes of the French coastline. Her analysis of the observant Franciscan “conversion to the sea” on certain French islands is particularly enlightening on how these mendicants adapted to their environment, both from an ideological as well as from a practical point of view: in their insular seclusion the friars engaged in salt production and exploited fisheries.While social marginalities, including gender, race and ethnicity, overall receive somewhat less attention in Mendicants on the Margins than geographical and historiographical marginality, these themes are taken up in the fascinating paper by Catherine Lawless on penitent women in Florence. After drawing attention to the marginality of female saints in the iconography of Florentine mendicant churches, Lawless brings into focus an even more invisible and marginal group of women, the secular female penitents living in houses close to monumental mendicant churches, looking to the friars for spiritual guidance. In the same section on social marginalities, Anne-Julie Lafaye masterfully complicates the seeming marginal, rural setting of Augustinian houses, by studying the ruined remains of Augustinian friaries in Ireland, and using architectural evidence to point out the centrality of these convents with respect to the communities which they served.The final two chapters of the volume implicitly draw attention to a further case of marginality in mendicant studies which is not addressed explicitly by the volume: the study of mendicant orders during the early modern period in Europe. This indeed points to one of the main qualities of this volume: it invites scholars to reflect more attentively on margins and marginalities in the study of mendicant orders, concerning which this reviewer learned a great deal.",

Therefore, integrating sustainability into software architecture is crucial for the long-term viability of organizations. In this study, we explore how new sustainability concerns can be effectively tackled within software architecture, especially when established architecture standards are followed. We present two main contributions derived from an industrial case study. First, we present the extension of existing architecture views, called decision maps, to trace the involvement of architecture standards. Such extension supports architects through informed decision making by integrating sustainability aspects while adhering to architecture standards. Second, we propose a set of key performance indicators to monitor the ongoing application of these standards and assess their impact on the software architecture and its sustainability over time. Our findings provide valuable insights and instruments for experts to first assess sustainability within the constraints of architecture standards, and then monitor their sustainability impact. This will help to meet regulatory requirements and align software design with strategic sustainability goals. We provide tangible guiding steps to improve sustainability awareness and decision-making.",

         "Comparing the Netherlands and Germany, and building on different theoretical perspectives on cooperation, we analyse whether works councils are able to accommodate and reconcile the competing demands of representation (relationship to the workforce), integration (relationship to management) and solidarity (relations to the union), or whether varying geometries of interest lead works councils to prefer one of those three demands. The analysis of an online-survey of 1,776 works councillors reveals differences and similarities between the two countries. Despite very similar institutional settings, multivariate statistical analysis shows that works councils differ in the priorities they set when choosing a preferred partner. German worker representatives feel close to the unions and workforce alike, while their Dutch counterparts maintain comparatively close relations to management. Nevertheless, we see many similarities as well. So, despite different historical trajectories and differences in regulatory detail, works councils have much in common in both countries, which suggests that they have a systematic impact on how employee voice materialises on the ground.",

         "Neurons in cortical networks are very sparsely connected; even neurons whose axons and dendrites overlap are highly unlikely to form a synaptic connection. What is the relevance of such sparse connectivity for a network’s function? Surprisingly, it has been shown that sparse connectivity impairs information processing in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Does this imply that sparse connectivity also impairs information processing in biological neural networks? Although ANNs were originally inspired by the brain, conventional ANNs differ substantially in their structural network architecture from cortical networks. To disentangle the relevance of these structural properties for information processing in networks, we systematically constructed ANNs constrained by interpretable features of cortical networks. We find that in large and recurrently connected networks, as are found in the cortex, sparse connectivity facilitates time- and data-efficient information processing. We explore the origins of these surprising findings and show that conventional dense ANNs distribute information across only a very small fraction of nodes, whereas sparse ANNs distribute information across more nodes. We show that sparsity is most critical in networks with fixed excitatory and inhibitory nodes, mirroring neuronal cell types in cortex. This constraint causes a large learning delay in densely connected networks which is eliminated by sparse connectivity. Taken together, our findings show that sparse connectivity enables efficient information processing given key constraints from cortical networks, setting the stage for further investigation into higher-order features of cortical connectivity.",

         "The proliferation of renewable energy contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals but also leads to waste issues and critical raw material dependencies. It is therefore important to study circular economy (CE) strategies for renewables to mitigate these challenges, while ensuring broad social participation and enhancing community and business resilience. We apply market failure and cooperative theory to explore how cooperative governance can enable and embed circularity in smart grids. Using a case study of a smart grid project in Belgium, we identify key barriers and enablers for fostering circular outcomes. Our findings suggest that cooperative governance can mitigate market failures involved, such as split incentives and asymmetric information, resolving missing markets and facilitating the integration of CE strategies in smart grids. Analysing design-implementation gaps and boundary conditions for scaling and replication highlights the importance of overcoming regulatory barriers and engaging stakeholders through compelling value propositions. While cooperatives are a promising model for advancing sustainable energy transitions, they require regulatory support and community involvement to realise their full potential. Smart grid development may be shaped by regional institutional contexts but the insights on cooperatives derived from this study have a broad international relevance given the globally applied and comparable framework employed.",

It argues that Schleitheim’s argument is more concerned with the political logic of the church than with ethical rules individual Christians are to obey. T he “sword” does not refer to violence in general but specifically to a particular logic of political domination. Seemingly anticipating modern discussions, this logic functions by making a distinction between lives: the “wicked” and the “good,” those that are protected and those lives given up to death. Although such authority can be legitimate, Schleitheim argues the church should strive to build communities that break with that logic, in emulation of Christ’s non-sovereign character. In the church, the theopolitical image of God as one who “ordains” is to be unlearned. The relationship between the two incompatible orders of sword and church remains underdetermined, giving rise to a wide spectrum of possible interactions and interminable negotiation.",

         "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as cathelicidins, show dual functionality by directly combating pathogens and indirectly eliminating them through stimulation of the immune system, generating interest in their therapeutic potential. Pigs have a large set of 11 cathelicidins, of which PMAP-37 is relatively understudied compared to some of the better-known cathelicidins. This study describes the effectiveness of PMAP-37 against both bacteria and viruses. PMAP-37 exhibited potent in vitro antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus globigii) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) with minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of 2.5 and 5 μM, respectively. PMAP-37 caused a rapid permeabilization of E. coli's outer and inner membranes within 5 min, indicating its efficacy in disrupting bacterial cell membranes. Furthermore, PMAP-37 neutralized nitric oxide production in a macrophage celline stimulated with various forms of LPS, LIPID A, or LTA in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed PMAP-37's capacity to inhibit LPS binding to macrophages, while zeta potential analysis showed the peptide's capacity to neutralize the negative charge of both the E. coli membrane and LPS micellular surfaces. Interestingly PMAP-37 also exhibited antiviral activity against an important porcine pathogen, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). These findings underscore the multifunctional properties of PMAP-37, and provides potential leads for future therapeutic use within the pig industry.",

         "Purpose: Although the doctor-patient relationship (DPR) in China has improved during the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts still persist, especially in high-pressure environments like emergency departments (EDs). Previous research has not explored how media portrayal of healthcare professionals impacts this relationship in emergency settings. This study aims to analyze the correlation between media representation of healthcare professionals and DPR in Chinese EDs, with the goal of identifying strategies to improve patient satisfaction, enhance trust and promote effective medical outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: This cross-sectional study was conducted across 40 hospitals in 8 provinces in China. Using a self-designed electronic questionnaire, data were collected from healthcare professionals. Multiple linear regression models were employed to analyze the correlation between the DPR and the portrayal of healthcare professionals by the media in ED. Findings: The results indicated a higher rate of verbal and physical conflicts in EDs, suggesting a tense DPR. The positive portrayal of healthcare professionals by the media is positively correlated with DPR and doctor-patient trust. Furthermore, the positive portrayal of healthcare professionals by the media is negatively correlated with the frequency of physical conflicts. Originality/value: The study highlights the media’s critical role in shaping public perceptions that impact DPRs, especially in high-stress settings. A comprehensive multi-stakeholder approach is recommended, involving media self-regulation, government policy, healthcare organization initiatives and empowered healthcare professionals. By strategically managing the media’s influence through this coordinated approach, the findings can drive enhanced trust, improved patient satisfaction and more effective medical outcomes.",

While management research has acknowledged the need for collective action in confronting these issues, the role of rhetoric remains underexplored. The papers that comprise this Special Issue collectively demonstrate how rhetoric is indispensable for shaping public discourse, framing critical issues, and challenging entrenched power structures. Beyond persuasion, rhetoric serves as a medium for constructing meaning, fostering shared understanding, and mobilizing stakeholders. Drawing from diverse theoretical and methodological traditions, the contributions in this issue explore the mechanisms by which rhetorical practices reshape cognition and spur collective action. The papers illuminate how language creates systemic change across a broad range of empirical contexts. New rhetorical techniques—such as rhetorical axioms, commensuration, impersonation, and dystopian rhetoric—emerge as critical tools for influencing societal values and facilitating institutional transformation. This issue advances research by integrating rhetorical perspectives with organizational theories, offering novel insights into adaptive responses to grand challenges. By connecting fragmented research streams, we highlight rhetoric’s profound capacity to inspire action, bridge ideological divides, and reimagine societal organization in the face of enduring global crises.",

         "Resilience has become an influential topic in academia, attracting the interest of an exponential number of scholars across a range of disciplines (Lovell et al., 2016; Métais et al., 2022). The term resilience stems from the physical sciences and refers to the capacity of objects and materials to bend without breaking and, after some time, return to its original shape or condition (Fletcher and Sarkar, 2013; Southwick and Charney, 2021). Over the last few decades, the concept has been applied in multiple domains: ecosystems, political systems, communities, cities, organizations, business, psychology, health care, education, child development, economic systems, international development, security, and sports. In today’s turbulent times, when extreme challenges such as climate change, polarization, and war undermine our belief in progress, the notion of resilience is particularly powerful because it holds the promise of recovery and hope.",

         "Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) has the potential to usher in a new era for human neuroscience by allowing spatially precise and high-resolution non-invasive targeting of both deep and superficial brain regions. Currently, fundamental research on the mechanisms of interaction between ultrasound and neural tissues is progressing in parallel with application-focused research. However, a major hurdle in the wider use of TUS is the selection of optimal parameters to enable safe and effective neuromodulation in humans. In this paper, we will discuss the major factors that determine the efficacy of TUS. We will discuss the thermal and mechanical biophysical effects of ultrasound, which underlie its biological effects, in the context of their relationships with tunable parameters. Based on this knowledge of biophysical effects, and drawing on concepts from radiotherapy, we propose a framework for conceptualising TUS dose.",

As one of the most significant developments in counterterrorism efforts in the last decades, counter-radicalization and violent extremism policies have substantial impact on nondominant peoples. It is intertwined with discourses on migration, integration, and religion, to name a few, and connected to law enforcement, civil society organizations, and informally organized communities. To provide an overview of the aim, focus, and reach of CR and CVE policies, the chapter describes the main lines of their development, from the origins of the discourse to its institutionalization on a supranational level. Consequently, it summarizes the main critiques, focusing on criticism regarding how CR and CVE policies institutionalize inequality and dominance. The chapter ends by discussing some of the implications of these critiques.",

         "OBJECTIVE: Oral healthcare practitioners (OHCPs) face risks for blood-borne viruses following blood exposure accidents (BEAs). This study aimed to investigate occupational BEAs in Dutch oral healthcare clinics, explore BEA risk factors, and identify reasons for non-reporting.DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Two questionnaires were distributed; one prospective questionnaire to BEA reporters who contacted a nationally operating reporting centre for occupational BEAs (issued before and after European legislation on recapping), and a retrospective questionnaire was sent to clinics which did not report any BEA in the previous 4 years. Data were analysed and logistic regression was applied to identify factors associated with BEA occurrence and reporting. This study is reported according to the STROBE-statement.RESULTS: 516 questionnaires were returned (37.7%), with 445 OHCPs having experienced a BEA, compared to 69 who have not. Most BEAs occurred with anaesthetic needles (43.3%) while cleaning up instruments (51.6%). Recapping remained an important cause after its prohibition (p=0.076). Dentists were less informed on safety protocols (p<0.001) and BEA consequences (p<0.001) compared to non-dentists (oral hygienists and dental assistants). OHCPs with accurate knowledge on BEA protocol were more likely to experience BEAs (OR=2.9, 95% CI1.5-5.6, p=0.001) and to report a BEA (OR=8.0, 95% CI3.9-16.5, p<0.001) than those without. Dentists have 0.3 times less odds (95% CI0.1-0.7, p=0.004) to report BEA than non-dentists, CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of guidelines more effectively is crucial to prevent and reduce blood-borne disease transmission. Changing attitudes and behaviours towards recapping and safety-engineered devices is essential, as recapping needles still causes many BEAs.",

         "The bottleneck model has dominated the field on dynamic congestion, as it is tractable and has closed-form solutions. But it has rather specific outcomes that do not occur in most other dynamic models or under static congestion. In the bottleneck model, pricing can remove all travel delays while keeping the generalized price unchanged, making pricing much more beneficial than in other models. Thus, it is important to see how pricing performs in other models. We do so by adding discrete preference heterogeneity to a dynamic flow congestion model, and we study the efficiency and distributional effects of pricing. By formulating a multi-point optimal-control problem using Hamiltonians, we derive the social optimum and analyze the properties of travel equilibrium. Solving our model is more complex than solving the bottleneck model, but still results in closed-from solutions, whereas most other dynamic congestion models have no such solutions. Without tolling, the arrival order is determined by the ratio of the value of time (VOT) to the value of schedule delay, as in the bottleneck model. However, unlike the bottleneck model, the same holds for the social optimum when only the VOT differs across users (as tolling cannot eliminate all travel time delays). In our model, users with a lower VOT always lose from tolling, while those with a higher VOT may gain or lose, depending on the parameters. Compared to the bottleneck model, tolling is less beneficial for society, lengthens the peak, and hurts users more. Our findings reveal the significance of considering congestion type and preference heterogeneity in assessing the implementation of congestion tolling.",

         "As climate-related disasters escalate, particularly in vulnerable communities in the Global South effective risk management strategies become necessary. The objective of this work was to examine the spatial dependencies between socioeconomic vulnerability and flood impacts in Southern Malawi, merging geospatial methods with econometric modeling. The analysis revealed significant spatial dependencies and spillover effects from data in the Unified Beneficiary Register, Malawi Census, and Rapid Damage Assessments from the 2020 and 2022 floods. Moran's I analysis emphasized the need to account for those spatial spillover effects. The spatial econometric framework, represented by a spatial lag variable in the Spatial Generalized Linear Model, captured these dependencies effectively. Expected associations emerged between flood impacts and socioeconomic indicators such as wealth, education, and household savings, suggesting that economically secure households are less vulnerable. However, unexpected correlations also appeared: food security was positively associated with flood impact, while disability occurrence showed a negative association. These findings challenge resilience assumptions and raise concerns about data accuracy and aftershock dynamics. Insights highlight the need for DRM strategies that incorporate exposure and socioeconomic indicators, along with improved data collection to ensure vulnerable groups are adequately represented. Despite challenges from data scarcity and spatial granularity, this study demonstrates the potential of Spatial Econometric Models to identify spatially interconnected vulnerabilities. The approach can be transferred to other contexts, but further research is needed to refine spatial resolutions and ensure actionable vulnerability characterizations. Integrating spatial dependencies into risk assessments highlights the need for spatially explicit policy interventions to strengthen resilience and advance risk-layering strategies.",

         "The authors of the main article argue that final hiring decisions must be made based on subjectivity and intuition, as this supposedly brings competitive advantages compared to highly standardized selection procedures and is also more humane and ethical. In doing so, the authors ignore the relevant literature, which clearly shows that better hiring decisions are made when information from selection methods is combined mechanically, using a transparent decision rule, rather than intuitively (holistically). The consistent use of decision rules thus increases the predictive accuracy of relevant criteria and is therefore more human than holistic, intuitive decision making. Nevertheless, information is rarely combined mechanically in practice. Decision rules are rarely used because they undermine the autonomy of decision makers. Promising interventions to improve personnel selection are discussed and include autonomy in the design of a decision rule, as well as the possibility of including holistic predictions in a decision rule or adjusting decision rule predictions holistically. These approaches preserve the autonomy of decision makers and result in better selection decisions than holistic combination.",

Historically, conventional machine learning approaches that heavily rely on extensive feature engineering have outperformed transformer-based language models on this task. Recently, closed-source generative large language models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable performance on NLI in a zero-shot setting, including promising results in open-set classification. However, closed-source LLMs have many disadvantages, such as high costs and undisclosed nature of training data. This study explores the potential of using open-source LLMs for NLI. Our results indicate that open-source LLMs do not reach the accuracy levels of closed-source LLMs when used out-of-the-box. However, when fine-tuned on labeled training data, open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to that of commercial LLMs.",

Our study aimed to identify, critically appraise, and summarize these studies in a qualitative meta-synthesis. Materials and methods: Medline, CINAHL and Embase were systematically searched to identify eligible articles from inception to June 2024. Qualitative studies were included and critically appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program. Insufficient-quality papers were excluded. We performed a meta-synthesis following (1) open coding by two independent researchers and (2) discussing codes during reflexivity meetings. Results: Ninety-eight studies were appraised, of which 53 were included. We reached thematic saturation, four themes were constructed: (1) care coordination and continuity, (2) communication, (3) patient and family involvement, and (4) individualized support and information exchange. For patients and families, tailored information and support are prerequisites for a seamless transition and an optimal recovery trajectory after hospital discharge. It is imperative that healthcare professionals communicate effectively within and across care settings to ensure multidisciplinary collaboration and care continuity. Conclusions: This study identifies essential elements of optimal transitional care. These findings could be supportive to researchers and healthcare professionals when (re)designing transitional care interventions to ensure care continuity after hospital discharge.",

         "Representing crystal structures for machine learning property prediction traditionally relies on either composition-based methods or structure-based graph neural networks (GNNs). While these methods have been successful in predicting certain properties, they fall short in accurately capturing the periodicity of crystal structures, particularly long-range information. In this work, we show that topological features derived from labeled quotient graphs (LQGs)--finite graph representations that encode bond topology without relying on real-space geometric information--can effectively predict non-local properties, i.e., properties that are not solely determined by individual local atomic environments. Using a dataset of 25,000 silica zeolite structures, we demonstrate that XGBoost models trained on LQG-derived topological features (XGB-LQG) outperform conventional GNNs (CGCNN, MEGNet) in predicting non-local properties. Furthermore, hybrid architectures that combine GNN embeddings with LQG features achieve intermediate performance, highlighting the complementary nature of geometric and topological representations. Our results establish LQGs as a powerful representation for incorporating bond topology into crystal property prediction.",

         "Background: This study was conducted to assess the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on dental healthcare workers (DHCWs) during the pandemic. Due to frequent exposure to aerosol-generating procedures, DHCWs are at an increased risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, increasing their mortality risk. Therefore, this retrospective study aimed to ascertain the mortality of DHCWs attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection from databases in the public domain during the pandemic. Methods: The data were obtained from three public-domain online databases: Medscape, FNOMCeO, and X. All collected data from March 2020 to May 2024 were merged into a tabulated format. An analysis was conducted on the data collectively and through a subgroup analysis based on the country, detailed profession, age, gender, and date of death. Results: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 100 DHCWs were deceased. The DHCWs in the study were employed in 14 countries, with the United States (40%) and Italy (34%) listing the highest percentages of deaths of these workers. Dentists constituted 79% of the total DHCWs. The gender distribution among the deceased was 85 (85%) men and 15 (15%) women. The age of 57 deceased DHCWs was known, resulting in a mean age of 58 years (ranging from 28 to 88). The DHCWs at ages 60 to 70 years (49%) exhibited the highest mortality rate from SARS-CoV-2. The date of death was known for 73 DHCWs, who were deceased between March 2020 and February 2023. Conclusion and clinical relevance: During the global pandemic, DHCWs worked in the context of general practice. The DHCWs adhered to infection prevention protocols according to standard guidelines and incorporated new adjunctive measures, especially for the pandemic, including adopting coronavirus disease 2019 guidelines for oral healthcare. These measures provided satisfactory protection, with less than 0.006% mortality of the estimated DHCWs worldwide.",

         "Mandibular reconstruction after oncologic resection is challenging owing to functional and esthetic demands. Three-dimensional virtual surgical planning enhances surgical predictability and precision. This study compared separate versus connected mandibular resection guides, hypothesizing that connected guides achieve more precise alignment with the virtual surgical plan, thereby improving resection accuracy and reconstruction outcomes. Twelve cadaver heads were used to evaluate the 2 guides. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were used to create a virtual surgical plan. The resections were then performed either using the connected or separate guide design. Post-operative CT scans were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the guide positioning and resection planes. The connected guide group showed significantly better translational alignment, with a median error of 0.7 mm versus 2.1 mm in the separate guide group (p = 0.02). However, the differences in rotational alignment (pitch and yaw) of the guides and subsequent resections planes were not statistically significant. The separate guide group exhibited a broader range of errors. In conclusion, the connected guide design demonstrated significantly better translation accuracy and narrower error ranges, making it more predictable and reliable. Although separate guides offer greater flexibility, their higher variability in positioning makes them less consistent for achieving precise resections.",

         "Native Language Identification (NLI) – the task of identifying the native language (L1) of a person based on their writing in the second language (L2) – has applications in forensics, marketing, and second language acquisition. Historically, conventional machine learning approaches that heavily rely on extensive feature engineering have outperformed transformer-based language models on this task. Recently, closed-source generative large language models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable performance on NLI in a zero-shot setting, including promising results in open-set classification. However, closed-source LLMs have many disadvantages, such as high costs and undisclosed nature of training data. This study explores the potential of using open-source LLMs for NLI. Our results indicate that open-source LLMs do not reach the accuracy levels of closed-source LLMs when used out-of-the-box. However, when fine-tuned on labeled training data, open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to that of commercial LLMs.",

         "Hypertension is one of the most common chronic diseases threatening human health, and early warning and intervention are crucial for controlling disease progression. However, in the real world, the sample data used for hypertension model training is often limited, posing challenges to model performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes an end-to-end hypertension early warning model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which can generate a large number of high-quality synthetic electronic health records(EHRs) in a small sample environment and directly use them for training the hypertension early warning model. Specifically, we use the processed data from the public MIMIC-III dataset as input and generate a large number of synthetic EHRs through GAN and LSTM networks. The GAN network generates realistic synthetic data through adversarial training of the discriminator and generator, while the LSTM network is used to capture time series features, thereby enhancing the authenticity and diversity of the data. After generating the synthetic data, these data are directly used to train the hypertension early warning model. The feedback mechanism during the generation of EHRs can continuously obtain higher prediction accuracy, thus optimizing the quality of the generated data until the optimal effect is achieved. Finally, the optimal hypertension early warning model and the corresponding synthetic data are saved. Experimental results show that the hypertension early warning model trained using synthetic data significantly improves the prediction accuracy on the test set, with higher sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional methods. This study verifies the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in a small sample environment, providing a new perspective for the utilization of large-scale medical data, and has a wide range of application prospects.",

To accomplish this, we followed two different strategies: 1) a graph-based generative model that encodes graph representations of knowledge related to hate speech, and 2) leveraging prompts for a large language model (LLM), specifically GPT-4o. We find that our graph-based approach tends to perform better in terms of traditional evaluation metrics (i.e., RougeL, BLEU, BERTScore), while the JudgeLM evaluation employed in the shared task favors the counter-narratives generated by the LLM-based approach, which was ranked second for English and third for Spanish on the leaderboard.",

However, the inherent lack of transparency in LLM outputs presents significant challenges given the sensitive nature of psychotherapy. Applying MI strategies, a set of MI skills, to generate more controllable therapeutic-adherent conversations with explainability provides a possible solution. In this work, we explore the alignment of LLMs with MI strategies by first prompting the LLMs to predict the appropriate strategies as reasoning and then utilizing these strategies to guide the subsequent dialogue generation. We seek to investigate whether such alignment leads to more controllable and explainable generations. Multiple experiments including automatic and human evaluations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of MI strategies in aligning psychotherapy dialogue generation. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs in producing strategically aligned dialogues and suggest directions for practical applications in psychotherapeutic settings.",

         "Text style transfer is a challenging research task which modifies the linguistic style of a given text to meet pre-set objectives such as making the text simpler or more accessible. Although large language models have been found to give promising results, text rewriting to improve audience engagement of social media content is vastly unexplored. Our research investigates the performance of various prompting strategies in the task of rewriting Dutch news tweets in specific linguistic styles (formal, casual, and factual). Apart from zero-shot and few-shot prompting variants, wit h and without personas, we also explore prompting with feedback on predicted engagement. We perform an extensive analysis of 18 different combinations of Large Language Models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Mistral-7B) and prompting strategies on three different metrics: ROUGE-L, semantic similarity, and predicted engagement. We find that GPT-4o with feedback and persona prompting performs the best in terms of predicted engagement for all three language styles. Our results motivate further exploration of applying prompting techniques to rewrite news headlines on Twitter to align with specific style guidelines.",

         "Retrieval-augmented generation has gained popularity as a framework to enhance large language models with external knowledge. However, its effectiveness hinges on the retrieval robustness of the model. If the model lacks retrieval robustness, its performance is constrained by the accuracy of the retriever, resulting in significant compromises when the retrieved context is irrelevant. In this paper, we evaluate the “implicit” retrieval robustness of various large language models, instructing them to directly output the final answer without explicitly judging the relevance of the retrieved context. Our findings reveal that fine-tuning on a mix of gold and distracting context significantly enhances the model's robustness to retrieval inaccuracies, while still maintaining its ability to extract correct answers when retrieval is accurate. This suggests that large language models can implicitly handle relevant or irrelevant retrieved context by learning solely from the supervision of the final answer in an end-to-end manner. Introducing an additional process for explicit relevance judgment can be unnecessary and disrupts the end-to-end approach.",

         "Background: Helm is a package manager that allows defining, installing, and upgrading applications with Kubernetes (K8s), a popular container orchestration platform. A Helm chart is a collection of files describing all dependencies, resources, and parameters required for deploying an application within a K8s cluster. Objective: The goal of this study is to mine and empirically evaluate the security of Helm charts, comparing the performance of existing tools in terms of misconfigurations reported by policies available by default, and measure to what extent LLMs could be used for removing misconfiguration. We also want to investigate whether there are false positives in both the LLM refactorings and the tool outputs. Method: We propose a pipeline to mine Helm charts from Artifact Hub, a popular centralized repository, and analyze them using state-of-the-art open-source tools, such as Checkov and KICS. First, such a pipeline will run several chart analyzers and identify the common and unique misconfigurations reported by each tool. Secondly, it will use LLMs to suggest mitigation for each misconfiguration. Finally, the chart refactoring previously generated will be analyzed again by the same tools to see whether it satisfies the tool's policies. At the same time, we will also perform a manual analysis on a subset of charts to evaluate whether there are false positive misconfigurations from the tool's reporting and in the LLM refactoring.",

Originating from the domain of pragmatics, the Gricean maxims are foundational principles aimed at optimising communicative effectiveness, encompassing the maxims of Quantity, Quality, Relation, and Manner. We explore how these principles are operationalised within NLP through the development of data sets, benchmarks, qualitative evaluation and the formulation of tasks such as Data-to-text, Referring Expressions, Conversational Agents, and Reasoning with a specific focus on Natural Language Generation (NLG). We further present current works on the integration of these maxims in the design and assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting their potential influence on enhancing model performance and interaction capabilities. Additionally, this paper identifies and discusses relevant challenges and opportunities, with a special emphasis on the cultural adaptation and contextual applicability of the Gricean maxims.

         "Traditional dataset retrieval systems rely on metadata for indexing, rather than on the underlying data values. However, high-quality metadata creation and enrichment often require manual annotations, which is a labour-intensive and challenging process to automate. In this study, we propose a method to support metadata enrichment using topic annotations generated by three Large Language Models (LLMs): ChatGPT-3.5, GoogleBard, and GoogleGemini. Our analysis focuses on classifying column headers based on domain-specific topics from the Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA), a Linked Data controlled vocabulary. Our approach operates in a zero-shot setting, integrating the controlled topic vocabulary directly within the input prompt. This integration serves as a Large Context Windows approach, with the aim of improving the results of the topic classification task.We evaluated the performance of the LLMs in terms of internal consistency, inter-machine alignment, and agreement with human classification. Additionally, we investigate the impact of contextual information (i.e., dataset description) on the classification outcomes. Our findings suggest that ChatGPT and GoogleGemini outperform GoogleBard in terms of internal consistency as well as LLM-human-agreement. Interestingly, we found that contextual information had no significant impact on LLM performance.This work proposes a novel approach that leverages LLMs for topic classification of column headers using a controlled vocabulary, presenting a practical application of LLMs and Large Context Windows within the Semantic Web domain. This approach has the potential to facilitate automated metadata enrichment, thereby enhancing dataset retrieval and the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) of research data on the Web.",

Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a specific application, we show that WAI is highly correlated with pandemic containment measures and reliably predicts firm performance. Unlike traditional data sources, WAI provides timely firm-level information across industries and geographies worldwide that would otherwise be unavailable due to institutional and data availability constraints.

Increasingly, Deep Learning models are having success in interface prediction. This study presents PIPENN-EMB which explores the added value of using embeddings from the ProtT5-XL protein language model. Our results show substantial improvement over the previously published PIPENN model for protein interaction interface prediction, reaching an MCC of 0.313 vs. 0.249, and AUROC 0.800 vs. 0.755 on the BIO_DL_TE test set. We furthermore show that these embeddings cover a broad range of 'hand-crafted' protein features in ablation studies. PIPENN-EMB reaches state-of-the-art performance on the ZK448 dataset for protein-protein interface prediction. We showcase predictions on 25 resistance-related proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Furthermore, whereas other state-of-the-art sequence-based methods perform worse for proteins that have little recognisable homology in their training data, PIPENN-EMB generalises to remote homologs, yielding stable AUROC across all three test sets with less than 30% sequence identity to the training dataset, and even to proteins with less than 15% sequence identity.",

         "representation and intuitive visual reasoning. This survey paper delves into data- and knowledge-driven scene representation and visual reasoning approaches based on deep learning, common sense knowledge and neurosymbolic integration. Itexplores how scene graph generation, a process that detects and analyses objects, visual relationships and attributes in scenes, serves as a symbolic scene representation. This representation forms the basis for higher-level visual reasoning tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, image retrieval, image generation, and multimodal event processing. Infusing common sense knowledge, particularly through the use of heterogeneous knowledge graphs, improves the accuracy, expressiveness and reasoning ability of the representation and allows for intuitive downstream reasoning. Neurosymbolic integration in these approaches ranges from loose to tight coupling of neural and symbolic components. The paper reviews and categorises the state-of-the-art knowledge-based neurosymbolic approaches for scene representation based on the types of deep learningarchitecture, common sense knowledge source and neurosymbolic integration used. The paper also discusses the visual reasoning tasks, datasets, evaluation metrics, key challenges and future directions, providing a comprehensive review of this researcharea and motivating further research into knowledge-enhanced and data-driven neurosymbolic scene representation and visual reasoning.",

         "Traditional Semantic Table Interpretation (STI) methods rely primarily on the underlying table data to create semantic annotations. This year’s SemTab challenge introduced the “Metadata to KG” track, which focuses on performing STI by using only metadata information, without access to the underlying data. In response, we introduce a new term: Column Vocabulary Association (CVA). This term refers to the task of semantic annotation of column headers solely based on metadata information. This study evaluates several methods for the CVA task, including a Large Language Models (LLMs) approach combined with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), using three commercial GPT models and four open-source models, along with temperature setting variations. We also evaluate a traditional similarity approach using SentenceBERT. Our experiments operate in a zero-shot setting, without fine-tuning or examples for the LLMs, to maintain a generalized and domain-agnostic application. Initial findings indicate that LLMs generally perform well at temperatures below 1.0, achieving an accuracy of 100% on the challenge test set. Traditional methods outperforms several LLMs, instead, when metadata and glossary are closely related. However, interim results on the full data set show that our approaches reach an accuracy of 70%, suggesting possible discrepancies in test representativeness, though further investigation is needed.",

         "Along with surgery and chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT) is a very effective method to treat cancer. The process is safety-critical, involving complex machines, human operators and software. A proactive hazard analysis to predict what can go wrong in the process is therefore crucial. Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is one of the methods widely used for risk assessment in healthcare. Unfortunately, the available resources and FMEA expertise strongly vary across different RT organizations worldwide. This paper describes i-SART, an interactive web-application that aims to close the gap by bringing together best practices in conducting a sound RT-FMEA. Central is a database that at present contains approximately 420 FMs collected from existing risk assessments and cleaned from ambiguities and duplicates using NLP techniques. Innovative is that the database is designed to grow, due to both user input and generative AI algorithms. This is work in progress. First experiments demonstrated that using machine learning in building i-START is beneficial. However, further efforts will be needed to search for better solutions that do not require human judgment for validation. We expect to release soon a prototype of i-SART that hopefully will contribute to the global implementation and promotion of safe RT practices.",

Historically, conventional machine learning approaches that heavily rely on extensive feature engineering have outperformed transformer-based language models on this task. Recently, closed-source generative large language models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable performance on NLI in a zero-shot setting, including promising results in open-set classification. However, closed-source LLMs have many disadvantages, such as high costs and undisclosed nature of training data. This study explores the potential of using open-source LLMs for NLI. Our results indicate that open-source LLMs do not reach the accuracy levels of closed-source LLMs when used out-of-the-box. However, when fine-tuned on labeled training data, open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to that of commercial LLMs.",

To date, most of these efforts have focused on the use of computational algorithms to compose music. Biomusic–music created using biological data–provides an alternative paradigm for the creation of non-human music which can be truly ecocentric. Photosynthetic organisms in particular offer the ability to create music which responds to changes in their environment, such as changes in light conditions and temperature. Herein, we propose how the ubiquitous bioelectrical activities of algae (which are correlated with their photosynthetic activity) can be utilized for biomusic generation. In addition to describing the scientific principles underpinning these algal biomusic systems, we also provide tutorial descriptions of the bioelectrochemical devices and signal processing pipelines which can be used to engineer them. In addition, we provide an overview of the many musical applications that can be accessed with this technology, highlighting a few pioneering examples of algal biomusic generation.",

         "Pretrained language models (LMs) have advanced a range of semantic tasks and have also shown promise for knowledge extraction from the models itself. Although several works have explored this ability in a setting called probing or prompting, the viability of knowledge base construction from LMs remains underexplored. In the 3rd edition of this challenge, participants were asked to build actual disambiguated knowledge bases from LMs, for given subjects and relations. In crucial difference to existing probing benchmarks like LAMA [1], we make no simplifying assumptions on relation cardinalities, i.e., a subject-entity can stand in relation with zero, one, or many object-entities. Furthermore, submissions need to go beyond just ranking predicted surface strings and materialize disambiguated entities in the output, which will be evaluated using established KB metrics of precision and recall. The challenge has a single track for LMs with a parameter level under 10-billion to fit into low computational requirements. The challenge received 8 submissions, of which 5 submitted a paper, and 4 were accepted for presentation. The challenge was collocated with a workshop on related topics, allowing to host extended discussions, related papers, and invited talks.",

Ontology modelling and semantic search, due to their inherent complexity, still demand considerable human effort and expertise. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces the problem of ontology text alignment, which involves finding the most relevant axioms with respect to the given reference text. We propose an advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation framework that leverages BERT models and generative LLMs, together with ontology semantic enhancement based on atomic decomposition. Additionally, we have developed benchmarks in geology and biomedical areas. Our evaluation demonstrates the positive impact of our framework.",

However, the integration of GenAI into digital platforms fundamentally transforms complementors’ role as GenAI is able to autonomously generate content which was previously exclusively performed by complementors. To understand how platforms manage the changing role of complementors in response to AI generated content, we draw from an in-depth qualitative study of a digital learning platform. This empirical case allows us to explore which tensions arise between platform complementors and GenAI’s agency, and how the platform provider engages in different boundary work to manage the changing role of complementors to ensure the platform’s viability.

         "The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has precipitated the rise of asynchronous video interviews (AVIs) as an alternative to conventional job interviews. These one-way video interviews are conducted online and can be analyzed using AI algorithms to automate and speed up the selection procedure. In particular, the swift advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly decreased the cost and technical barrier to developing AI systems for automatic personality and interview performance evaluation. However, the generative and task-unspecific nature of LLMs might pose potential risks and biases when evaluating humans based on their AVI responses. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the validity, reliability, fairness, and rating patterns of two widely-used LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in assessing personality and interview performance from an AVI. We compared the personality and interview performance ratings of the LLMs with the ratings from a task-specific AI model and human annotators using simulated AVI responses of 685 participants. The results show that LLMs can achieve similar or even better zero-shot validity compared with the task-specific AI model when predicting personality traits. The verbal explanations for predicting personality traits generated by LLMs are interpretable by the personality items that are designed according to psychological theories. However, LLMs also suffered from uneven performance across different traits, insufficient test-retest reliability, and the emergence of certain biases. Thus, it is necessary to exercise caution when applying LLMs for human-related application scenarios, especially for significant decisions such as employment.",

         "The climate crisis is a salient issue in online discussions, and hypocrisy accusations are a central rhetorical element in these debates. However, for large-scale text analysis, hypocrisy accusation detection is an understudied tool, most often defined as a smaller subtask of fallacious argument detection. In this paper, we define hypocrisy accusation detection as an independent task in NLP, and identify different relevant subtypes of hypocrisy accusations. Our Climate Hypocrisy Accusation Corpus (CHAC) consists of 420 Reddit climate debate comments, expert-annotated into two different types of hypocrisy accusations: personal versus political hypocrisy. We evaluate few-shot in-context learning with 6 shots and 3 instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting hypocrisy accusations in this dataset. Results indicate that the GPT-4o and Llama-3 models in particular show promise in detecting hypocrisy accusations (F1 reaching 0.68, while previous work shows F1 of 0.44). However, context matters for a complex semantic concept such as hypocrisy accusations, and we find models struggle especially at identifying political hypocrisy accusations compared to personal moral hypocrisy. Our study contributes new insights in hypocrisy detection and climate change discourse, and is a stepping stone for large-scale analysis of hypocrisy accusation in online climate debates.",

         "Although word predictability is commonly considered an important factor in reading, sophisticated accounts of predictability in theories of reading are lacking. Computational models of reading traditionally use cloze norming as a proxy of word predictability, but what cloze norms precisely capture remains unclear. This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can fill this gap. Contextual predictions are implemented via a novel parallel-graded mechanism, where all predicted words at a given position are pre-activated as a function of contextual certainty, which varies dynamically as text processing unfolds. Through reading simulations with OB1-reader, a cognitive model of word recognition and eye-movement control in reading, we compare the model’s fit to eye-movement data when using predictability values derived from a cloze task against those derived from LLMs (GPT-2 and LLaMA). Root Mean Square Error between simulated and human eye movements indicates that LLM predictability provides a better fit than cloze. This is the first study to use LLMs to augment a cognitive model of reading with higher-order language processing while proposing a mechanism on the interplay between word predictability and eye movements.",

The method enables collective random walks: Swarms of simple individuals using only local interactions flock together while navigating in a random direction. In this paper, we introduce swarm leaders that emerge through a mechanism based on local sensing. Upon emerging, leaders combine social interactions with a goal direction, that is generated using Lévy or Correlated Random Walks processes. Key findings highlight that the aggregated swarm behaviours are random-walk-like, and tend towards Lévy-like dynamics increasing swarm size, irrespective of the emergent leader process. Furthermore, we explore how leader distribution affects the trajectory of the swarm, revealing the potential for optimized movement strategies through the manipulation of leadership roles. The introduction of emergent implicit leadership offers a novel perspective on achieving complex navigational behaviors in swarm robotics, presenting significant implications for applications requiring adaptive, decentralized exploration strategies.",

Code Llama, an LLM from Meta, is one of the most recent LLM tools. However, currently there is no objective assessment of the energy efficiency of the source code generated by Code Llama. Goal. In this paper, we present an empirical study that assesses the energy efficiency of the source code generated by Code Llama with respect to human-written source code. Method. We design an experiment involving three human-written programming problems implemented in C++, JavaScript, and Python. We ask Code Llama to generate the code of the problems using different prompts and temperatures, which sets the predictability of the output of an LLM. Therefore, we execute both implementations and profile their energy efficiency. Results. Our study shows that the energy efficiency of the code generated by Code Llama varies according to the chosen programming language and code characteristics. Human implementations tend to be more energy efficient overall, with generated JavaScript code outperforming its human counterpart. In addition, explicitly asking Code Llama to generate energy-efficient code results in an equal or worse energy efficiency, and using different temperatures does not seem to affect the energy efficiency of generated code. Conclusions. According to our results, code generated using Code Llama does not guarantee energy efficiency, even when prompted to do so. Therefore, software developers should evaluate the energy efficiency of generated code before integrating it into the software system under development.",

         "Recently, the question of what types of computation and cognition large language models (LLMs) are capable of has received increasing attention. With models clearly capable of convincingly faking true reasoning behavior, the question of whether they are also capable of real reasoning—and how the difference should be defined—becomes increasingly vexed. Here we introduce a new tool, Logic Tensor Probes (LTP), that may help to shed light on the problem. Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) serve as a neural symbolic framework designed for differentiable fuzzy logics. Using a pretrained LLM with frozen weights, an LTP uses the LTN framework as a diagnostic tool. This allows for the detection and localization of logical deductions within LLMs, enabling the use of first-order logic as a versatile modeling language for investigating the internal mechanisms of LLMs. The LTP can make deductions from basic assertions, and track if the model makes the same deductions from the natural language equivalent, and if so, where in the model this happens. We validate our approach through proof-of-concept experiments on hand-crafted knowledge bases derived from WordNet and on smaller samples from FrameNet.",

With the overwhelming availability of (mis)information online, it can be difficult for users to discern credible sources from unreliable ones. Moreover, while a wide range of opinions and perspectives are more accessible than ever before, the algorithms that drive content delivery often prioritize engagement over accuracy, leading to the reinforcement of existing biases. The rise of generative AI technologies further complicates and intensifies these issues. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) technologies could play a crucial role in guiding users through this increasingly complex information landscape. NLU focuses on developing language models that can understand and extract meaning from human language. Such models can be leveraged in applications designed to help users navigate and interpret information more effectively. In this context, the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task is particularly relevant, which involves predicting whether the truth of one sentence (the hypothesis) entails, contradicts, or is neutral with respect to another sentence (the premise). This process requires a sophisticated understanding of the logical relationships between propositions and the ability to evaluate how different perspectives on these propositions interact. Effective NLI models could therefore aid in the interpretation and evaluation of diverse and potentially conflicting sources. However, for language models to be truly effective, they must be trained and evaluated on high-quality language resources. While impressive advancements are made with increasingly proficient models, the focus on developing and refining them can overshadow the need to evaluate them on diverse, representative, and challenging datasets. This thesis evaluates the current state of language resources and identifies ways to enhance their effectiveness, especially in modeling natural online debates. It addresses various aspects of quality and representativeness, with a specific focus on capturing nuances in both textual meaning and human interpretation. The work emphasizes the need for perspective-aware resources that preserve the authenticity of language in datasets, ensuring that models are better equipped for real-world applications. The findings and recommendations presented aim to guide future advancements in NLU research, particularly in the construction of more representative datasets.",

         "As a core cognitive skill that enables the transferability of information across domains, analogical reasoning has been extensively studied for both humans and computational models. However, while cognitive theories of analogy often focus on narratives and study the distinction between surface, relational, and system similarities, existing work in natural language processing has a narrower focus as far as relational analogies between word pairs. This gap brings a natural question: can state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) detect system analogies between narratives? To gain insight into this question and extend word-based relational analogies to relational system analogies, we devise a comprehensive computational framework that operationalizes dominant theories of analogy, using narrative elements to create surface and system map-pings. Leveraging the interplay between these mappings, we create a binary task and benchmark for Analogical Reasoning on Narratives (ARN), covering four categories of far (cross-domain)/near (within-domain) analogies and disanalogies. We show that while all LLMs can largely recognize near analogies, even the largest ones struggle with far analogies in a zero-shot setting, with GPT4.0 scoring below random. Guiding the models through solved examples and Chain-of-Thought reasoning enhances their analogical reasoning ability. Yet, since even in the few-shot setting, the best model only performs halfway between random and humans, ARN opens exciting directions for computational analogical reasoners.",

         "Human-robot interaction often employs the Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) paradigm, where a human controls the robot. However, this approach has limitations, such as a lack of autonomy that impedes real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) can replace WoZ in conversational tasks, such as brainstorming. We propose that, in such application domains, LLM-controlled robots can achieve comparable perceived social intelligence to WoZ-controlled robots. An experiment (n=27, within-subject design) tested this by having participants brainstorm with an LLM- and WoZ-controlled Furhat robot. Bayesian analyses revealed substantial evidence for the null model for perceived social intelligence, social presentation, and social information processing, indicating similar perceptions of social intelligence for WoZ- and LLM-controlled robots. Participants tentatively preferred the LLM-controlled robot, and reliably identified when the robot was WoZ- or LLM-controlled. This study highlights the potential of LLMs to replace the WoZ paradigm and transform HRI in various research and application domains.",

         "Deep learning has become a major field with many applications: from face recognition to generating images to compressing data. As a result, deep learning is becoming more and more integrated into our daily lives. We demonstrate how deep learning can be deployed for several applications in three different domains namely, improving business processes for agriculture, high-dimensional density estimation with generative models, and neural compression of data. The first domain aims to optimize the business process of a seed breeding company operating in agriculture. Therefore, we examine a dataset of white cabbage seedling images. The aim is to predict the (un)successfulness of the seedlings based on only an image. Since accurate and early predictions can terminate the seedlings stay in a growth chamber, which provides more space for other seeds to grow. Further, automating the process aids professionals. We show how a particular convolutional neural network, AlexNet, outperforms the other machine learning methods and that the model can accurately determine if a seedling is going to grow (un)successfully. Moreover, we observe that training AlexNet on earlier days generalizes to predictions on later days. The second domain concerns the utilization of generative modeling for high dimensional density estimation since this is an open problem in deep learning. We aid to close the gap in estimating the true data distribution that is modeled with generative models. More concretely, we improve model performance of a generative model, known as the normalizing flow. Therefore, we construct new methods and propose an activation function, which we call Concatenated LipSwish. The new architecture is known as i-DenseNet and outperforms its predecessor Residual Flow and other comparable flow-based models on generative and hybrid modeling performance. Finally, the third domain covers the neural compression process for images and videos. With the growing amount of data worldwide, compression, in general, has become a fundamental part of data storage and transmission. We first examine a neural image compression model, known as the mean-scale hyperprior. Even though these models are effective in practice, they do have limited capacity when it comes to optimization and generalization. Therefore, we introduce three new refinement methods that aids the compression performance and results in improved compression results per image. Additionally, we aim to optimize the latents of an already pre-trained image compression model, by keeping the networks weights fixed, and only further optimizing its latents with the refinement procedures. We show how the method can be extended to three-class rounding, outperforms the baselines, can be used to move partly along the rate-distortion curve and how it is robust to hyperparameter changes. Finally, we introduce a neural video compression model, based on scale-space flow, that allocates more bits to pre-specified regions-of-interest. We introduce two versions that are able to achieve this, namely, an implicit and a latent scaling model. In general, both models out-perform all baselines in terms of the rate-distortion performance in regions of interest and can generalize to different datasets at inference time. The latent scaling model has the best performance and can explicitly control the quantization binwidth of latent variables by only using a single model during evaluation. Further, we find that the models show a negligible performance gap when trained with synthetic region-of-interest masks, which do not correlate with the content of the video, compared to training with pixel-wise annotated masks.",

         "From millions of social media posts, to decades of legal text - more and more relevant information is hidden in digital text corpora that are too large for manual analyses. The key promise of machine learning is to automate parts of the manual analysis process. One popular method is supervised machine learning for text classification, where a model is trained on examples of manually categorized texts and learns to identify these categories in new texts. Computational social scientists have used this method to create measurements of concepts such as emotions, topics or stances at scale. While measurement with supervised machine learning is established in the social science literature, there are important limitations that reduce the usefulness of established methods for many practical applications. First, these methods require large amounts of balanced training data to work well. Researchers, however, often only have limited resources for creating training data and need to tailor new data to each new research question. Second, older algorithms struggle with multilingual data. Researchers, however, need measurements that are equally valid for different cultures and languages. Third, they are susceptible to learning shortcuts and biased patterns from their training data, reducing the validity of measurements across social groups. Fourth, they can be difficult to use, making them only accessible to specialised researchers. This thesis demonstrates how a recent innovation from the natural language processing literature can address these limitations: instruction-based language models. Chapter 2 shows how this type of model can reduce the required training data by a factor of ten compared to previous algorithms, while achieving the same level of performance across eight tasks. Chapter 3 demonstrates how these models require less than 2000 examples in two languages to create valid measurements across eight other languages and ten other countries. Chapter 4 shows how these models are more robust against group-specific biases. Their average test-set performance only decreases marginally when trained on biased data in experiments across nine groups from four datasets. Chapter 5 explains how these models can be universal classifiers that can learn any number of classification tasks simultaneously in tests across 33 datasets with 389 classes.",

This article addresses a crucial managerial challenge: While employees are including the tool as their private knowledge assistant in many aspects of their daily work, it is difficult for managers to see and understand the impact within their organization. There is more and more literature on what ChatGPT means for business, but we cannot say much as long as we are uninformed about its actual use. So, getting an insider's perspective is needed to think about the consequences for organizations. The article is grounded in a qualitative study of employees’ experiences of interacting with ChatGPT among 50 early ChatGPT adopters. First, we show how employee-ChatGPT relations develop from private, experimental use into an integral part of knowledge work. Second, we identify six affordances: searching for information, brainstorming ideas, structuring content, writing a first draft, embellishing text, and proofing work. Further, we highlight three looming side effects of ChatGPT use that threaten knowledge ties, the quality of knowledge in organizations, and how work roles are configured. Accordingly, this article offers managers guidance in managing a ChatGPT-empowered workforce in a way that aims to mitigate these side effects while harnessing opportunities.",

Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have become very powerful to mimic how people use language, including value-laden content. We explore the opportunities for supervised fine-tuning and prompt engineering the LLMs in order to better perform a downstream task such as finding value-laden content in text. We compare fine-tuning, which heavily relies on labeled data, to the more flexible approach of prompt engineering that requires less or no labeled data at all. Our goal in this paper is three-fold: 1) assess the capabilities of closed source (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o) versus open source (Gemini and Llama3) LLMs, 2) analyse the influence of domain-specific information by comparing fine-tuning with prompts, and 3) compare multi-label with single-label approaches.",

         "Hyperparameter optimization is a crucial problem in Evolutionary Computation. In fact, the values of the hyperparameters directly impact the trajectory taken by the optimization process, and their choice requires extensive reasoning by human operators. Although a variety of self-adaptive Evolutionary Algorithms have been proposed in the literature, no definitive solution has been found. In this work, we perform a preliminary investigation to automate the reasoning process that leads to the choice of hyperparameter values. We employ two open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), namely Llama2-70b and Mixtral, to analyze the optimization logs online and provide novel real-time hyperparameter recommendations. We study our approach in the context of step-size adaptation for (1 + 1)-ES. The results suggest that LLMs can be an effective method for optimizing hyperparameters in Evolution Strategies, encouraging further research in this direction.",

         "This paper describes the contribution of team GESIS-DSM to the Perspective Argument Retrieval Task, a task on retrieving socioculturally relevant and diverse arguments for different user queries. Our experiments and analyses aim to explore the nature of the sociocultural specialization in argument retrieval: (how) do the arguments written by different socio-cultural groups differ? We investigate the impact of content and style for the task of identifying arguments relevant to a query and a certain demographic attribute. In its different configurations, our system employs sentence embedding representations, arguments generated with Large Language Model, as well as stylistic features. Our final method places third overall in the shared task, and, in comparison, does particularly well in the most difficult evaluation scenario, where the socio-cultural background of the argument author is implicit (i.e. has to be inferred from the text). This result indicates that socio-cultural differences in argument production may indeed be a matter of style.",

         "Language models like BERT or GPT are becoming increasingly popular measurement tools, but are the measurements they produce valid? Literature suggests that there is still a relevant gap between the ambitions of computational text analysis methods and the validity of their outputs. One prominent threat to validity is hidden biases in the training data, where models learn group-specific language patterns instead of the concept researchers want to measure. This paper investigates to what extent these biases impact the validity of measurements created with language models. We conduct a comparative analysis across nine group types in four datasets with three types of classification models, focusing on the robustness of models against biases and on the validity of their outputs. While we find that all types of models learn biases, the effects on validity are surprisingly small. In particular when models receive instructions as an additional input, they become more robust against biases from the fine-tuning data and produce more valid measurements across different groups. An instruction-based model (BERT-NLI) sees its average test-set performance decrease by only 0.4% F1 macro when trained on biased data and its error probability on groups it has not seen during training increases only by 0.8%.",

         "We compare the results from a recent global expert survey on climate policy with answers to the same survey by the online artificial-intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. Such a study is timely and relevant as many people around the world are likely to use ChatGPT and similar language models to inquire about climate solutions, which in turn might influence public opinion. The comparison provides insights about performance criteria, policy instruments, and use of information from distinct academic disciplines. With a few exceptions, responses by ChatGPT are informative and of high quality. We find that ChatGPT answers questions with less bias than experts from various scientific disciplines. The latter may also be a disadvantage as it seems to weight all the information available equally without accounting well for relevance, which arguably may require human rather than artificial intelligence. On the other hand, experts from distinct disciplines show difference in average responses, with some even expressing opinions inconsistent with objective evidence, meaning there is no consistent and unbiased expert opinion on climate policy. As a new way of synthesizing large amounts of academic and grey literature, ChatGPT can serve policymaking. However, since the procedure that it follows for collecting and summarizing information remains a black box, it is best regarded as a complement rather than a substitute to traditional literature reviews and expert surveys.",

However, manual coding is labor-intensive, and automation efforts are hindered by the lack of data due to the privacy of psychotherapy. To address these challenges, we introduce BiMISC, a bilingual dataset of MI conversations in English and Dutch, sourced from real counseling sessions. Expert annotations in BiMISC adhere strictly to the motivational interviewing skills code (MISC) scheme, offering a pivotal resource for MI research. Additionally, we present a novel approach to elicit the MISC expertise from Large language models (LLMs) for MI coding. Through the in-depth analysis of BiMISC and the evaluation of our proposed approach, we demonstrate that the LLM-based approach yields results closely aligned with expert annotations and maintains consistent performance across different languages. Our contributions not only furnish the MI community with a valuable bilingual dataset but also spotlight the potential of LLMs in MI coding, laying the foundation for future MI research.",

         "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to both exacerbate and ameliorate existing socioeconomic inequalities. In this article, we provide a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary overview of the potential impacts of generative AI on (mis)information and three information-intensive domains: work, education, and healthcare. Our goal is to highlight how generative AI could worsen existing inequalities while illuminating how AI may help mitigate pervasive social problems. In the information domain, generative AI can democratize content creation and access but may dramatically expand the production and proliferation of misinformation. In the workplace, it can boost productivity and create new jobs, but the benefits will likely be distributed unevenly. In education, it offers personalized learning, but may widen the digital divide. In healthcare, it might improve diagnostics and accessibility, but could deepen pre-existing inequalities. In each section, we cover a specific topic, evaluate existing research, identify critical gaps, and recommend research directions, including explicit trade-offs that complicate the derivation of a priori hypotheses. We conclude with a section highlighting the role of policymaking to maximize generative AI's potential to reduce inequalities while mitigating its harmful effects. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of existing policy frameworks in the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, observing that each fails to fully confront the socioeconomic challenges we have identified. We propose several concrete policies that could promote shared prosperity through the advancement of generative AI. This article emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaborations to understand and address the complex challenges of generative AI.",
